In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction: The backstory introduces a 'double role' where Thalcave is hired by a British Geographical Society expedition and alters the route to protect sacred Indian sites. This contradicts the canonical narrative where Thalcave joins Lord Glenarvan's expedition to find Captain Grant, driven by a desire to help and a natural inclination to guide those in need. There is no mention of any prior commitment to a British Geographical Society or any indication that he would prioritize protecting sacred Indian sites over assisting in the search for Captain Grant. This creates a conflict of interest and motivation that is not supported by the canon.

Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: The backstory also introduces a level of deception and hidden agenda that is not present in Thalcave's character as portrayed in the novel. He is presented as a straightforward and trustworthy guide, loyal to the mission of finding Captain Grant. The backstory's claim that he secretly altered the route to protect sacred Indian sites would require him to deceive the expedition members, which is inconsistent with his established character.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Noirtier's known revolutionary past aligns with the described activities. The novel does not provide a detailed account of his activities during the Revolution, so this backstory does not contradict any established narrative constraints.
