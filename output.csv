The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"The canonical summary explicitly states that Noirtier is a zealous Bonapartist while Villefort is a Royalist, and that their relationship is strained by these opposing political histories. This directly supports the backstory's claim that Villefort’s drift toward Royalism disappointed his Bonapartist father and that they argued politics frequently. No entry in the knowledge graph or summary contradicts this; rather, it expands on the existing tension without introducing factual inconsistencies. Additionally, later events (e.g., Villefort’s attempts to protect his reputation and the eventual poisoning plot) remain logically coherent given this early political conflict. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical facts.

- Graph facts: Noirtier --[FORMER_ROLE]--> Bonapartist; Noirtier --[FORMER_ROLE]--> Girondin; Villefort is described as the Procureur du Roi (Royalist) in the summary.
- Summary fact: 'relationship with his son, Villefort, is strained by their opposing political histories—Villefort being a Royalist and Noirtier a Bonapartist'.
- Narrative logic: A father disapproving of his son's political shift and frequent political arguments fits the established father‑son dynamic and does not conflict with any later plot points."
The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"The backstory adds information about Noirtier's parents being targeted in a reprisal for supporting the Revolution, with his mother being killed. The canonical summary never mentions the fate of Noirtier's parents, so this detail is extra information that does not directly conflict with any stated fact. It aligns with his known revolutionary past (former Girondin, Senator, Bonapartist) and does not contradict his later actions—e.g., his opposition to the marriage, his will, or his poisoning immunity. No narrative inconsistency arises; the added trauma could plausibly deepen his distrust of authority, which is compatible with his manipulative and strategic personality. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical facts.

**Evidence Queries**:
1. Query the novel for any explicit mention of Noirtier's mother or her death to verify the backstory claim.
2. Query the novel for descriptions of Noirtier's early revolutionary activities that could involve family reprisals.
3. Query the novel for any statements about the political climate that might explain a reprisal against Noirtier's parents."
In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"The knowledge graph contains no statements about a Captain Grant, a forged logbook, mutiny, or a keel‑less lifeboat. The backstory introduces these elements as new narrative details. Since the graph only records known relationships (e.g., Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce's alias, employment, runaway involvement, quartermaster role, and acquaintance with Harry Grant and Mary Grant), the backstory's events are not contradicted by any explicit fact. They are therefore treated as additional information that expands the character's story without violating the recorded canonical facts. No later canonical events are specified that would be made impossible by this backstory, and there is no logical impossibility (e.g., being in two places at once) implied. Hence the backstory is consistent with the provided canonical context."
