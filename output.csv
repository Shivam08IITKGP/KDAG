In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Step 1 – LENS 1: No factual contradiction with canon. The novel never specifies Thalcave’s family background, parental fate, or childhood activities. Therefore the claim that his father was ""the last of the tribal guides"" and that his mother died giving birth does not oppose any established fact; it merely introduces details that are absent from, but not at odds with, the canonical description. Step 2 – LENS 2: The backstory respects narrative constraints. It does not grant Thalcave plot‑changing authority, alter any known event, or introduce supernatural elements. Instead, it reinforces his canonical expertise (e.g., his skill with horses, tracking, and navigation), which aligns with his role as a baqueano. No later canonical episode (e.g., his separation during the flood) would be rendered impossible by this childhood narrative. Step 3 – LENS 3: The added details are non‑conflicting expansions that fill an otherwise vague portion of his biography. They serve as plausible motivations and background without violating tone or character consistency. Consequently, the backstory is consistent with the novel.

**Why this is not contradictory**: The Knowledge Graph contains no nodes or edges describing Thalcave’s parents, his upbringing, or the circumstances of his mother’s death. Hence no factual edge can block the added statements. Moreover, the proposed timeline (childhood roaming the plains before adulthood) fits chronologically with his later appearance as a guide for Glenarvan’s expedition.

**Potential verification queries**:
1. Query 1: [Verify that the novel does not state that Thalcave’s mother survived childbirth or that his father was not the last tribal guide]
2. Query 2: [Check that Thalcave’s childhood activities (tracking, taming horses, navigating by stars) are not explicitly contradicted by any canonical passage]
3. Query 3: [Confirm that there is no chronological conflict between an early‑life experience described here and his first appearance with Glenarvan’s expedition]

The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONTRADICTING,"**LENS 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION** – The backstory asserts that in 1815 Faria was ""re‑arrested"" and shipped to the Château d’If ""this time for life.""  The canonical novel states that Faria has been confined in the Château d’If continuously since 1811 and is never described as being released, nor as undergoing a later arrest.  The only imprisonment of Faria mentioned is his original 1811 incarceration, which persists until his death.  Claiming a second, later arrest directly contradicts this established timeline and status.  Because a clear factual conflict exists, the backstory is immediately labeled contradictory; LENSES 2 and 3 need not be examined."
