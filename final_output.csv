95,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,0.7975853085517883,False,"The backstory claim that Noirtier, fearing denouncement by Villefort, preemptively handed the conspiracy dossier to a British spy, leading to Villefort's ""lawful"" murder of Dantès, is consistent with Noirtier's established character and political affiliations. His history as a zealous Bonapartist, his participation in revolutionary activities, and his known willingness to act decisively to protect his interests all support the plausibility of this action. While the graph doesn't explicitly state this event, it provides ample evidence of Noirtier's capacity for such a maneuver.","['“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to ...', 'Noirtier’s eye continued to say, “Read.” He resume...', 'Villefort hung his head, d’Avrigny approached near...', '“No pity, procureur; the crime is fragrant.

136,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONTRADICTING,0.7868596911430359,True,"Lens 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory states that from 1800 onward, Faria lived quietly on a small island, drafting a vast work. However, the canonical text states that Faria was imprisoned in the Château d'If in 1811 for his political aspirations regarding a unified Italy. This contradicts the backstory, as he could not have been living quietly on an island while imprisoned. The knowledge graph also shows Faria was imprisoned in the fortress of Fenestrelle and Piombino. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.
