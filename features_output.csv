0,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not provide details about Thalcave's parents or early life, so the backstory does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Thalcave's people faded as colonists advanced, and that his father was a tribal guide who taught him about the pampas. This backstory does not violate character agency, create a tone mismatch, break a causal chain, or violate completeness. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Thalcave's early life and family history. It expands on the vague canon by providing a plausible explanation for his skills and knowledge of the Pampas. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical novel.

1,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory states Faria was re-arrested in 1815 and sent to the Château d'If for life. The canonical text states Faria was imprisoned in the Château d'If since 1811. This does not directly contradict the backstory, as it could be interpreted as a continuation of his imprisonment. However, the backstory implies a separate arrest and imprisonment. The knowledge graph shows Faria was imprisoned in the Château d'If, fortress of Fenestrelle, and Piombino. It does not specify the dates of imprisonment in each location, so it is possible he was imprisoned elsewhere before 1811. 
Lens 2: The narrative plausibility is maintained. It is possible that Faria was arrested again in 1815 and sent back to the Château d'If. This does not create a paradox with later events. The novel does not explicitly state that Faria was never arrested again after his initial imprisonment.

2,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Kai-Koumou. The novel does not mention anything about his pre-battle rituals or his mother's shark-tooth necklace. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It adds a layer of cultural belief and personal ritual to Kai-Koumou's character, which aligns with his role as a Maori chief. It doesn't violate his agency or create any paradoxes with later events. The novel does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Kai-Koumou's personal beliefs and rituals, enriching his character without contradicting any established facts. It provides a plausible explanation for his boldness and decision-making before

Noirtier's Bonapartist leanings and Villefort's Royalist sympathies are explicitly stated in the novel, creating a natural basis for political disagreements. Lens 2: The backstory is narratively plausible. It aligns with the strained relationship between Noirtier and Villefort due to their opposing political views. The novel implies a significant ideological divide, making frequent arguments a logical extension of their dynamic. Lens 3: The backstory adds a reasonable level of detail by suggesting that these arguments occurred at 'every family gathering.' This enriches the character dynamic without contradicting any established facts.

4,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. The novel does not mention Noirtier's parents or their fate. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Noirtier's distrust of authority is consistent with his revolutionary past and Bonapartist leanings. The death of his mother as a result of reprisals for supporting the Revolution provides a reasonable motivation for his radical political views. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information that enriches Noirtier's character without conflicting with the canon.

5,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONTRADICTING,"LENS 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION - The backstory states that Ayrton locked Captain Grant in a keel-less lifeboat. However, the canonical text states that Ayrton was forcibly put ashore on the Australian coast by Grant for instigating a mutiny. There is no mention of Ayrton locking Grant in a lifeboat. This contradicts the established events leading to Ayrton's abandonment. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

LENS 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY - The backstory creates a causal chain break. If Ayrton had locked Grant in a keel-less lifeboat, it would significantly alter the circumstances of Grant's disappearance and the subsequent search. The novel's plot relies on the established fact that Grant was lost at sea due to a shipwreck, not due to Ayrton's direct action of locking him in a lifeboat.

6,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of Paganel's family or early life in the novel, so this backstory does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Paganel, a man of strong moral character, would report bribery and be wary of the upper nobility. This does not create a paradox with later events, nor is it too specific about events the novel treats as unknown/mysterious.

7,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. Ayrton's interactions with indigenous populations are not explicitly detailed, leaving room for this scenario. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints. Ayrton's cunning and adaptability could reasonably lead him to seek alliances with indigenous groups and learn their skills. This does not create a paradox with later events, as his betrayal of the group is still consistent with his character. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich Ayrton's history. It provides a possible explanation for his knowledge of the Australian landscape and his ability to survive in the wilderness. It also adds a layer of complexity to his character by suggesting a potential motivation beyond pure self-interest.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Ayrton knowledge or skills he shouldn't have, as his resourcefulness and adaptability are already established in the

8,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of his early life in the original text, so the backstory does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. The backstory provides a plausible origin for his fierce warrior persona and his connection to Maori traditions. It does not violate character agency, introduce supernatural elements, or break any causal chains. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Kai-Koumou's childhood and early life, enriching his character without contradicting the canonical text. The flame-shaped birthmark and the fashioning of his first battle-axe are plausible additions that explain his later traits and behaviors.

ADVERSARIAL CHECK: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give the character knowledge or skills they shouldn't have, and it aligns with his later actions and motivations.",1,0.00465643685311079,0.0011491115437820554,0.00465643685311079,-0.002234621671959758,0.11179808527231216,-0.008646290749311447,0.038700077682733536,-0.05447986721992493,-0.038991667330265045,0.09488783031702042,0.009086505509912968,-0.07995892316102982,0.047349270433187485,0.06759743392467499,-0.03018864430487156,-0.028082098811864853,0.0061814007349312305,-0.04258878156542778,-0.007401356473565102,-0.09072679281234741,0.020105745643377304,0.008171198889613152,-0.00718803983181715,-0.02507355809211731,0.09888088703155518,0.03647809475660324,-0.01567971147596836,0.0731387659907341,0.005566248670220375,-0.031245708465576172,-0.0023281637113541365,0.06066840514540672,0.0065180109813809395,-0.0065169380977749825,-0.09785982966423035,-0.061073269695043564,0.015326903201639652,-0.0645218938589096,-0.01084425114095211,0.022977782413363457,0.016145162284374237,-0.014936184510588646,0.024000676348805428,0.03117026574909687,0.047961026430130005,-0.006647821981459856,-0.0026165011804550886,0.021815530955791473,0.030637061223387718,-0.042110297828912735,0.004089578986167908,0.05309060961008072,0.07027757912874222,0.06480288505554199,-0.10920897871255875,-0.006903987843543291,-0.017421862110495567,0.07549012452363968,0.010201004333794117,-0.009110319428145885,-0.04545768350362778,0.06549214571714401,0.039486635476350784,0.002736925147473812,0.038186654448509216,-0.032437585294246674,0.012219585478305817,-0.043005604296922684,-0.09964607656002045,0.1414259374141693,-0.06537968665361404,-0.0817687064409256,0.0742780789732933,0.06461770832538605,-0.0533275306224823,0.012040994130074978,-0.04552749916911125,-0.1435822993516922,-0.0005255726864561439,-0.019736183807253838,-0.016843758523464203,0.013291992247104645,-0.03769192844629288,0.02157248929142952,0.07428650557994843,-0.010900684632360935,0.04814834147691727,-0.047282952815294266,0.031491853296756744,-0.020779943093657494,0.012830523774027824,-0.01233482826501131,-0.015216963365674019,0.021688232198357582,-0.020004281774163246,-0.039529744535684586,0.051669955253601074,0.0055494955740869045,0.019284291192889214,0.03377702087163925,0.07497201859951019,-0.07542156428098679,0.03539126366376877,-0.01938183419406414,-0.04446025565266609,-0.00015024330059532076,0.019934432581067085,-0.04563486576080322,0.01115283090621233,-0.10387077927589417,0.028980575501918793,-0.08819828927516937,0.03819093108177185,0.0008251794497482479,0.0004382251645438373,-0.06170414388179779,0.07331588864326477,0.04638168215751648,0.03368014469742775,-0.02898726426064968,-0.03313804045319557,-0.12809349596500397,0.038337595760822296,0.0112302266061306,0.07167977839708328,-0.00543602230027318,0.06455127149820328,-0.010115635581314564,-0.0327586904168129,0.026201989501714706,-1.0067606774628908e-33,0.07953186333179474,-0.010054782964289188,-0.10531972348690033,-0.05319276079535484,0.02384532429277897,0.004638618789613247,-0.06780973821878433,0.02271873876452446,-0.007411609403789043,0.0029730561655014753,0.005992124788463116,-0.019024576991796494,0.01984306052327156,-0.007200527936220169,-0.018706005066633224,0.050091661512851715,-0.04896307364106178,-0.04518065229058266,0.05499991029500961,-0.02592926286160946,-0.053617384284734726,0.08082001656293869,-0.0019339298596605659,-0.060545288026332855,-0.0038528754375874996,0.059869181364774704,-0.04209122434258461,-0.060922134667634964,-0.01619318313896656,0.010083017870783806,-0.03737933933734894,-0.05905066430568695,0.024363258853554726,-0.03379116207361221,0.04456209018826485,-0.05206580087542534,0.038714490830898285,-0.13345582783222198,-0.14780646562576294,-0.005192489363253117,0.0961882621049881,0.00021721041412092745,-0.04002587869763374,-0.0036725159734487534,-0.014059269800782204,0.0326802097260952,0.023265888914465904,0.015496155247092247,-0.025071682408452034,-0.010806219652295113,-0.0014106233138591051,0.08719096332788467,0.047038398683071136,-0.018579667434096336,-0.05663585662841797,0.0856952890753746,0.021545100957155228,-0.01130126602947712,0.011431154794991016,0.012575572356581688,0.020679190754890442,-0.04485974460840225,0.0530865453183651,0.029668832197785378,-0.014039164409041405,-0.06900464743375778,-0.055909398943185806,0.03484955430030823,-0.032656289637088776,-0.030529845505952835,0.018032854422926903,-0.0652032122015953,-0.08750373870134354,-0.07783732563257217,-0.02306973561644554,0.013056233525276184,0.07725130766630173,0.05556642264127731,-0.1656913012266159,-0.04704776406288147,-0.0032122114207595587,0.0031662145629525185,-0.061832211911678314,0.02894335612654686,0.01919056847691536,0.019009165465831757,0.06796939671039581,-0.125110924243927,-0.01655658520758152,0.018091287463903427,0.022987212985754013,-0.018475115299224854,0.006188587751239538,-0.1482240855693817,-0.071355901658535,-1.0851722118054838e-33,0.011168992146849632,0.0046975985169410706,0.01685960404574871,0.05583072081208229,0.0249963216483593,-0.05762387812137604,-0.03786490857601166,0.10271979868412018,-0.0404428169131279,-0.07122667133808136,-0

9,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of a sweetheart or academic reports in the original text, so this is not a contradiction. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Paganel could have made such a mistake, given his absent-mindedness. It does not violate character agency, tone, or causal chains.

10,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Kai-Koumou. The novel mentions his cruelty and fierceness, which could be consistent with the trauma of friendly fire and the adoption of a hardened persona. The backstory does not introduce any impossible events or timeline breaks.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It provides a possible motivation for Kai-Koumou's cruelty and emotional detachment, which are traits already present in his canonical characterization. It does not violate character agency or introduce supernatural elements. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new details about Kai-Koumou's past that are not explicitly mentioned in the novel, but it does so in a way that is consistent with his established character and motivations. It enriches his history without breaking established facts.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It provides a plausible explanation for his cruelty and fierceness, traits already present in the canonical characterization.",1,0.011593732982873917,0.0008437520591542125,0.011593732982873917,-0.002465026918798685,0.12716594338417053,0.029937343671917915,-0.012773801572620869,0.060844093561172485,-0.01344320084899664,0.10831138491630554,0.002331510651856661,-0.08761832118034363,0.0505126528441906,0.006122330203652382,0.011108603328466415,0.009304884821176529,0.016058381646871567,0.02176981419324875,-0.015633122995495796,-0.041446465998888016,0.05399402603507042,-0.08007419109344482,0.06838025152683258,-0.035212066024541855,0.06101863086223602,0.0716881975531578,0.003009459236636758,0.037308767437934875,-0.0018157149897888303,0.03568878397345543,0.0003500168677419424,0.028629126027226448,0.018780935555696487,0.025515403598546982,-0.10477881878614426,-0.03051086515188217,-0.020126795396208763,-0.04649772495031357,0.07108339667320251,0.03463086485862732,0.01579979807138443,-0.051986340433359146,0.002873167162761092,-0.046900566667318344,-0.03067442774772644,-0.008413943462073803,0.03172247111797333,0.0282587930560112,0.006467343773692846,-0.051682256162166595,-0.04284185543656349,0.05504698306322098,0.007395364344120026,0.03255999833345413,0.053710270673036575,-0.04095103591680527,0.002949676476418972,0.04690728336572647,-0.1308286339044571,0.031584233045578,-0.015186416916549206,-0.01078597828745842,-0.0667223334312439,0.033456895500421524,-0.010713531635701656,0.026549898087978363,0.04373512044548988,0.051320601254701614,-0.0812743529677391,0.11535464227199554,-0.03568847104907036,0.014841645024716854,0.06647466868162155,-0.008077283389866352,-0.03145341947674751,0.08163860440254211,-0.07205777615308762,-0.0867726132273674,0.009744731709361076,-0.02909727767109871,-0.051067084074020386,-0.014268442057073116,-0.042418140918016434,-0.03738684207201004,-0.014960949309170246,0.03145590052008629,0.07216090708971024,-0.0023655020631849766,-0.012538658455014229,-0.016953863203525543,-0.019791118800640106,0.003365177195519209,0.08717279136180878,-0.059822019189596176,-0.006529286038130522,0.08914736658334732,0.08222242444753647,-0.03313322737812996,-0.03187784180045128,0.0057553574442863464,0.13223262131214142,-0.060563404113054276,0.03619953244924545,0.02095501869916916,0.01142667606472969,-0.0832197442650795,0.01114680152386427,0.045954860746860504,-0.055212683975696564,-0.11475226283073425,-0.06183701753616333,-0.005611895117908716,-0.003019824158400297,0.0110416105017066,-0.03076414205133915,-0.1085229441523552,0.004188032820820808,0.009775565937161446,0.03209790214896202,-0.04050515219569206,-0.041167981922626495,-0.04146605730056763,0.05196290463209152,0.06305336952209473,0.03820010647177696,-0.05585779622197151,0.04509115591645241,-0.041886571794748306,0.0563763827085495,-0.030589204281568527,-2.0316517022482846e-33,0.007674017455428839,-0.015094306319952011,-0.04994119703769684,0.016876162961125374,-0.011450131423771381,-0.05607578903436661,-0.07218170166015625,-0.025745684280991554,0.04538536071777344,0.04383998364210129,-0.010132905095815659,-0.0008407369023188949,0.07576940953731537,-0.059162989258766174,-0.08412434905767441,0.039399534463882446,-0.07020238041877747,-0.0339454747736454,0.03290781006217003,-0.027356497943401337,-0.0420026071369648,0.037302568554878235,0.018044553697109222,0.03125086426734924,-0.05240514129400253,0.006127519067376852,-0.07374410331249237,-0.006548034958541393,0.020961862057447433,0.0188605934381485,-0.0692446306347847,-0.0071517289616167545,0.05834513530135155,-0.011252645403146744,0.06650955975055695,-0.001761150429956615,-0.0013797067804262042,-0.03193429857492447,-0.10132817924022675,-0.008142602629959583,0.07291565835475922,0.002220302587375045,0.018319211900234222,-0.04602237045764923,0.049640003591775894,-0.020444553345441818,-0.09231571853160858,-0.00207448098808527,0.0068526240065693855,-0.005724130664020777,0.05931182950735092,-0.010067174211144447,0.059543877840042114,-0.030872855335474014,0.015928039327263832,0.11433573067188263,-0.006076792720705271,-0.002211536280810833,0.014713711105287075,0.09893714636564255,0.025787467136979103,-0.02798290178179741,0.09285123646259308,0.020991802215576172,-0.018471885472536087,-0.08634127676486969,-0.03809099644422531,-0.058373235166072845,-0.06306032091379166,-0.02369089052081108,-0.008654019795358181,0.041600100696086884,-0.017587142065167427,-0.07933424413204193,-0.08641687035560608,-0.015569007024168968,0.047838687896728516,0.030312951654195786,-0.14428074657917023,0.003144225338473916,0.025133470073342323,-0.043841004371643066,-0.07476559281349182,0.0696004182100296,-0.03737559914588928,0.042727142572402954,-0.008024691604077816,-0.17931663990020752,-0.020976582542061806,0.06713372468948364,-0.08305550366640091,-0.1295900195837021,-0.05847720056772232,-0.08085467666387558,-0.10069829970598221,-8.079083592770309e-34,0.019201595336198807,0.051030922681093216,-0.06782294809818268,0.05220923572778702,0.006028683856129646,-0.030495451763272285,-0.03658540919423103,0.06727265566587448,-0.00494197616353631,0.041399940848350525,-0.0

11,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory places Kai-Koumou in Tasmania at age 18, associating him with the escaped convict Ayrton. This contradicts the established fact that Kai-Koumou is a Maori chief in New Zealand. There is no mention of him ever leaving New Zealand or having any connection to Tasmania or Ayrton in the canonical text. This makes the backstory impossible.

Lens 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY: The novel's plot requires that Kai-Koumou be a Maori chief deeply rooted in New Zealand culture and resistance against colonial forces. A formative experience in Tasmania with an escaped convict would fundamentally alter his character and motivations, creating a paradox with his later actions in the novel.

Lens 3: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: N/A, as the backstory is contradictory.

12,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Abbé Faria. The canonical text does not explicitly state what Faria did after graduation. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Faria is portrayed as a political idealist, so it is reasonable that he would be involved in a secret society against corrupt rulers. This does not violate any narrative constraints. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new information about Faria's activities after graduation, which is not covered in the canonical text.

13,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory states that Noirtier, under the alias ""Citizen Noirtier,"" joined the Girondins, drafted parts of the Revolutionary Code, and broke with Robespierre. The canonical text confirms Noirtier was a Girondin. There is no explicit contradiction regarding his involvement in drafting the Revolutionary Code or his break with Robespierre. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It aligns with Noirtier's revolutionary background and his known political affiliations. The novel does not provide specific details about his early revolutionary activities, so this backstory does not contradict any established narrative constraints.

14,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. The novel provides details about Kai-Koumou's appearance, status, and actions, but it does not specify details about his birth, parents, or early life. The backstory's claim about his father being a war-chief and his mother being a priestess is not explicitly contradicted. The description of his father's death and the vengeance curse are also not contradicted. 

Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It provides a plausible origin story for Kai-Koumou's fierce resistance against colonial forces and his capacity for cruelty, which are traits already established in the canon. The backstory does not introduce any elements that would create a paradox with later events or violate character agency. 

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich Kai-Koumou's history. It provides a possible explanation for his hatred of the British and his motivation for resisting colonial forces. The backstory fills a narrative gap without breaking established facts.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Kai-Koumou knowledge or skills he shouldn't have.",1,0.004854838829487562,0.0011206637136638165,0.004854838829487562,-0.004692093934863806,0.08964481949806213,-0.027563834562897682,0.032867591828107834,0.0008733799331821501,-0.027998249977827072,0.132183238863945,-0.01776093617081642,-0.06531278789043427,0.010899417102336884,0.03777803108096123,-0.10732781141996384,-0.018969325348734856,0.0016431327676400542,-0.06736447662115097,0.07859621196985245,-0.030351268127560616,0.010960596613585949,0.026160473003983498,0.04204489290714264,-0.060537151992321014,0.06669533997774124,0.12908366322517395,-0.021321596577763557,0.01963256113231182,0.0326300747692585,0.03711540624499321,0.08147550374269485,0.03719331696629524,-0.03732122480869293,-0.037309516221284866,-0.04188679903745651,-0.0831054151058197,0.049075253307819366,-0.07624095678329468,0.022487839683890343,0.0326838381588459,0.11028501391410828,0.012791835702955723,0.0012230281718075275,0.024731967598199844,0.06713397800922394,-0.06166132539510727,0.011762810871005058,0.08195646107196808,0.0016584700206294656,-0.03901777043938637,-0.019414938986301422,-0.01731950044631958,0.06561533361673355,-0.07506756484508514,-0.06093309819698334,0.03591890260577202,-0.05333244800567627,0.01444668136537075,-0.07069030404090881,0.03197998180985451,-0.01085186842828989,-0.006239593494683504,0.011403627693653107,-0.004309065639972687,-0.033069171011447906,-0.0030992699321359396,-0.01617998629808426,0.026149392127990723,-0.05245130509138107,0.1184832751750946,-0.013858688995242119,-0.04046676307916641,-0.04046780243515968,0.013503075577318668,-0.0037922237534075975,0.0217435322701931,-0.006319867447018623,-0.07889735698699951,0.031713444739580154,-0.024547580629587173,0.05003716051578522,-0.0780385285615921,0.06350449472665787,-0.028221121057868004,0.021248262375593185,0.02497616969048977,0.038439031690359116,0.034181542694568634,0.04622987285256386,-0.00473143020644784,-0.06900311261415482,-0.025174083188176155,0.02770920656621456,-0.01063474640250206,-0.040098365396261215,0.012168817222118378,0.009790103882551193,0.09206850826740265,-0.000816582702100277,-0.0447872094810009,0.07913456112146378,-0.08056939393281937,0.03695088252425194,0.003095637308433652,-0.02978626638650894,-0.013176081702113152,0.030077340081334114,0.039291732013225555,0.01794336922466755,-0.0513305626809597,-0.05956355482339859,-0.06962867081165314,-0.018718590959906578,-0.008364045061171055,0.038902729749679565,-0.06748302280902863,-0.00540125509724021,0.09892425686120987,0.02929171361029148,0.009391936473548412,0.04009074717760086,-0.05002306029200554,-0.01273478101938963,0.015726234763860703,0.0538959875702858,-0.08852548897266388,-0.022541923448443413,-0.05607997253537178,-0.015662550926208496,-0.08703909814357758,1.2049020970729918e-33,0.005937424022704363,0.05133337527513504,-0.008408371359109879,0.04105822369456291,0.03979121521115303,0.057949963957071304,-0.05746930465102196,-0.028159022331237793,-0.06394597142934799,-0.03626202046871185,-0.009039250202476978,-0.13423466682434082,-0.007425060961395502,-0.03488684818148613,-0.08229334652423859,0.07179107517004013,-0.03437831625342369,-0.08173972368240356,0.025077607482671738,0.020007137209177017,-0.006771911401301622,0.09317899495363235,-0.0342068076133728,-0.06900463998317719,-0.028483936563134193,0.03455599769949913,0.0023993419017642736,-0.07950897514820099,-0.0123716676607728,-0.01086948998272419,-0.04846470430493355,0.05075022578239441,0.0754135400056839,-0.046451665461063385,0.04719986766576767,-0.050891753286123276,-0.007270916365087032,-0.047093138098716736,-0.030489293858408928,0.03666072338819504,0.07460882514715195,-0.01464138738811016,-0.01585756614804268,0.02417544089257717,-0.07068833708763123,0.010251169092953205,-0.010724599473178387,-0.057765573263168335,0.1084391325712204,0.04144229739904404,0.003538171062245965,-0.002801780356094241,-0.03694795072078705,-0.0507337860763073,0.015007474459707737,0.0456492081284523,-0.02586454525589943,-0.027345407754182816,-0.020969662815332413,0.039960939437150955,0.019128041341900826,-0.09640556573867798,0.031364358961582184,0.050329893827438354,-0.08645609766244888,-0.16572710871696472,-0.008806291967630386,0.025115881115198135,0.029263174161314964,-0.10010938346385956,0.02587260492146015,-0.008530229330062866,-0.01670754700899124,-0.07861345261335373,-0.052327558398246765,0.013160616159439087,0.001214281190186739,0.031933192163705826,-0.05751040577888489,-0.048378027975559235,-0.029384620487689972,0.12289416044950485,0.03574474900960922,-0.03339430317282677,-0.010160214267671108,-0.03761908411979675,-0.016703134402632713,-0.09057420492172241,0.02661990374326706,0.07359682768583298,0.017973249778151512,-0.00452099833637476,-0.05893824249505997,-0.13491162657737732,-0.11484174430370331,-3.171792693127607e-33,0.035416074097156525,-0.036140237003564835,0.09089134633541107,0.05498669296503067,0.014829651452600956,-0.10176265984773636,0.029304280877113342,0.12378095835447311,0.00841599889099598,0.028137020766735077,0.031073587015271187,0.01911

15,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction. The backstory states that Noirtier met the Count of Monte Cristo and aided him. However, Noirtier is paralyzed and unable to communicate effectively from approximately 1829 onwards. The Count of Monte Cristo's revenge plot takes place between 1838 and 1844. It is therefore impossible for Noirtier to have met and aided Monte Cristo during the period of the revenge plot due to his paralysis. This contradicts the established timeline and Noirtier's physical condition. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility. The novel does not hint at any collaboration between Noirtier and the Count of Monte Cristo. The Count's information sources are different, and Noirtier's condition would make such collaboration highly improbable and noticeable, which it is not.

Lens 3: Additional Information.

16,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of Kai-Koumou's mother or any specific rituals in the canonical text, so this backstory does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. The addition of a ""Blood-and-Bone"" rite and the act of ""breathing in her spirit"" does not introduce supernatural elements that clash with the novel's tone. The ritual is presented as a personal practice that explains his gloominess and unyielding nature, which aligns with his fierce and determined character as portrayed in the novel. The backstory does not violate character agency, break causal chains, or violate completeness. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich Kai-Koumou's character. It provides a plausible explanation for his unyielding nature and occasional gloominess, which are consistent with his role as a fierce warrior and leader facing colonial resistance. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical

17,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not mention Thalcave's prior employment or motivations before meeting Glenarvan's party. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Thalcave could have been hired by a British Geographical Society expedition and quietly altered the route to shield sacred Indian sites. This does not contradict any events in the novel. Thalcave's respect for native culture is consistent with his character.

18,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: There is no direct factual contradiction in the provided backstory. However, the backstory implies that Paganel had the authority or expertise to prevent the wreck of the Britannia, which is not supported by the canonical text. Paganel is a geographer, not a naval architect or ship's captain. The novel does not suggest he had any involvement or expertise in shipbuilding or navigation that would allow him to prevent a shipwreck. 

Lens 2: The backstory violates character agency. It gives Paganel a level of influence and responsibility that is not consistent with his established role as a somewhat absent-minded but brilliant geographer. The novel portrays him as a scholar, not someone involved in the technical aspects of ship design or operation.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It provides a possible motivation for Paganel's deference to Lady Glenarvan and his dedication to geography. It suggests a personal reason for his desire to be a ""living map,"" which aligns with his character's enthusiasm for geography and his desire to be helpful. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It expands on Paganel's character by providing a possible explanation for his behavior and motivations. It fills a narrative gap without breaking established facts. The idea that he might have ""tangled feelings"" for his mother and that this might influence his relationships with other women is a plausible psychological detail.

20,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory states that Noirtier acted as a militant republican during the Revolution, attended major assemblies, and helped organize trials of royalists. This does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. Noirtier is known to have been a revolutionary, and the backstory provides more detail about his activities during that period. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It aligns with Noirtier's known political leanings and provides a reasonable explanation for his revolutionary zeal. The novel does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events.

21,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. The novel does not explicitly state when Villefort sought to marry into the aristocracy, nor does it detail Noirtier's reaction to such a prospect in his younger years. The burning of a betrothal contract is not mentioned, but it doesn't violate any explicit canonical information. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints. Noirtier's strong political convictions and opposition to the aristocracy are well-established. It is reasonable to assume he would strongly oppose his son's marriage into such a family. The act of publicly burning the contract, while dramatic, is in line with his character as a passionate revolutionary. Villefort fleeing to Paris overnight is also plausible, given the potential consequences of defying his father's wishes and the political climate of the time. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new details that enrich Noirtier's history and provide a plausible explanation for his strained relationship with Villefort. It fills a gap in the narrative without breaking established facts. It provides a specific instance of their political conflict and highlights Noirtier's strong will and determination.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Noirtier knowledge or skills he shouldn't have. It is a plausible expansion of their relationship.",1,0.4315990209579468,0.017730150371789932,0.4315990209579468,-0.025525005534291267,0.08225496858358383,-0.04138752818107605,-0.017955232411623,0.09139851480722427,0.008120245300233364,-0.04936392605304718,0.008275805972516537,-0.024194998666644096,-0.03801959380507469,0.05202705040574074,-0.04934978857636452,-0.04880102723836899,-0.0722113847732544,0.017594339326024055,-0.01402970589697361,-0.059045009315013885,0.07974573969841003,0.030622631311416626,0.07695520669221878,-0.0901234969496727,-0.033696506172418594,0.02315141260623932,0.011712685227394104,0.01750665344297886,0.021959364414215088,0.04022752866148949,0.025316564366221428,0.023029783740639687,0.02369348518550396,0.02867930941283703,0.03572650998830795,-0.04889100790023804,0.04865490272641182,0.022011781111359596,-0.026837769895792007,-0.004149958491325378,-0.014073784463107586,-0.06634978950023651,0.0643615871667862,-0.02727389894425869,-0.008869233541190624,-0.01602928526699543,-0.03977937251329422,-0.021906673908233643,-0.044552747160196304,-0.0023974599316716194,0.017976855859160423,0.05423182249069214,0.012011406943202019,0.004885259084403515,0.034609097987413406,0.023286394774913788,-0.023323997855186462,-0.045136574655771255,0.05474312976002693,0.05285954847931862,0.06024646386504173,0.0438922718167305,0.03079908713698387,0.020690543577075005,0.0556439608335495,-0.08536914736032486,-0.023060103878378868,-0.0352909155189991,-0.049647387117147446,0.03778589889407158,-0.025451600551605225,-0.010784321464598179,0.0818893164396286,-0.0689992755651474,0.021742580458521843,-0.0028658690862357616,-0.08552877604961395,0.02786652185022831,0.01734098233282566,-0.045769594609737396,-0.053592171519994736,0.002131073735654354,-0.12807369232177734,-0.020315689966082573,0.017705978825688362,-0.010627727024257183,0.028452055528759956,0.0047238664701581,0.027997678145766258,0.06789388507604599,-0.058115988969802856,0.07441895455121994,0.018905246630311012,-0.0066744801588356495,-0.067940853536129,-0.007502330467104912,0.0538279227912426,-0.03195847198367119,0.008888506330549717,0.027041800320148468,0.08791469782590866,-0.012421787716448307,-0.0395662859082222,-0.04043878614902496,-0.024205731227993965,-0.09430944919586182,0.028376402333378792,0.03185800835490227,0.03627736493945122,0.04617265239357948,0.007755796890705824,-0.01892072707414627,-0.009121153503656387,-0.03923361003398895,-0.06541111320257187,0.0409981906414032,-0.0924488827586174,0.05265124514698982,0.029522154480218887,-0.06284493952989578,-0.008241347968578339,-0.04304808750748634,-0.010191336274147034,0.019828379154205322,0.06811439990997314,-0.06251495331525803,0.040380679070949554,-0.07287001609802246,-0.039090514183044434,0.04355457052588463,-1.5685089484052188e-34,0.04391218349337578,0.08332573622465134,-0.0494779571890831,0.04333537817001343,0.03549014404416084,0.02026248537003994,-0.024721605703234673,0.057857464998960495,-0.013207009993493557,0.027969835326075554,0.015081368386745453,-0.108466237783432,-0.0862245038151741,-0.026335077360272408,-0.03931483253836632,0.005748518742620945,0.05526643991470337,0.002966600237414241,0.05252424255013466,-0.06477531790733337,-0.0007815263816155493,0.10475505888462067,0.011458657681941986,-0.006777449045330286,0.003549553221091628,0.012066501192748547,-0.007496607955545187,0.04311911016702652,0.038916125893592834,0.009267305955290794,-0.07863086462020874,0.044658366590738297,0.0882326140999794,-0.062497276812791824,0.04552225023508072,0.08706243336200714,-0.008132291957736015,-0.07804322987794876,-0.03367191180586815,0.0791887417435646,-0.0570828877389431,-0.02956627868115902,-0.023089829832315445,-0.022695738822221756,-0.06339056044816971,-0.010191083885729313,0.02615729346871376,0.01276144664734602,0.07989845424890518,-0.04819278046488762,-0.0511946827173233,-0.023863069713115692,-0.013500964269042015,-0.041259318590164185,-0.011582264676690102,0.007542476058006287,-0.09294121712446213,-0.01441948115825653,0.010316317901015282,0.014382469467818737,0.06520703434944153,-0.06771520525217056,0.02818402834236622,0.0795576423406601,-0.08172640204429626,-0.043803758919239044,0.0028383589815348387,0.051876116544008255,-0.051095347851514816,-0.09597603231668472,-0.12666408717632294,-0.00709492526948452,-0.011109192855656147,-0.12746776640415192,0.08643613010644913,0.051708318293094635,-0.06553713232278824,0.034169115126132965,-0.09334250539541245,-0.05498133972287178,-0.09469099342823029,0.029870683327317238,0.035314690321683884,0.009280756115913391,-0.0058006830513477325,-0.017152229323983192,0.01991904340684414,0.011871043592691422,-0.02083822712302208,0.09067399799823761,-0.09515071660280228,-0.11748064309358597,0.03456731513142586,-0.039048708975315094,0.016794616356492043,-2.654667197932951e-33,-0.035692766308784485,0.010099138133227825,0.020970070734620094,-0.006213940214365721,0.006245182361453772,-0.0403764508664608,0.004155933856964111,0.012469376437366009,-0.02390105649828911,-0.016084274277091026,-0.05295584723353386,-0.069222

22,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There are no factual contradictions. The backstory does not introduce any events or details that directly conflict with the established canon. Paganel's early life is not detailed in the novel, so there is no information to contradict. 
Lens 2: The backstory is narratively plausible. It aligns with Paganel's later interest in geography and his absent-minded professor persona. It provides a reasonable origin for his passion for geography and his dedication to scientific pursuits. The backstory does not violate any character agency or create any causal chain breaks. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information that enriches Paganel's history. It provides a plausible explanation for his interest in geography and his early development as a scholar. It does not contradict any established facts and fills a narrative gap without breaking narrative logic. The detail about his father's scolding is consistent with the idea that Paganel's passion was not initially seen as a serious pursuit.",1,0.023999059572815895,0.005436945240944624,0.023999059572815895,0.08060485869646072,0.050427041947841644,0.07013841718435287,0.014428503811359406,-0.012950059026479721,-0.07082518935203552,0.04992063716053963,-0.07984338700771332,0.0022414810955524445,-0.03620850294828415,-0.02668832801282406,0.0008061515400186181,-0.02559334598481655,0.03145962953567505,-0.017135558649897575,-0.04860793054103851,-0.09393490105867386,0.06123373657464981,0.021209774538874626,-0.034426331520080566,-0.04957180097699165,-0.01069670170545578,0.017033623531460762,-0.022053472697734833,0.08807295560836792,-0.02033853530883789,0.010373217053711414,-0.0721784308552742,-0.01259972620755434,0.04115542024374008,0.013109147548675537,0.08295789361000061,-0.06334374845027924,-0.010142574086785316,-0.006264800205826759,0.03551139310002327,0.0465354360640049,0.03444095700979233,-0.028482457622885704,-0.04011005908250809,0.0012932090321555734,-0.01670435070991516,0.024123458191752434,0.06016923114657402,-0.07707831263542175,-0.0316651277244091,0.009729298762977123,-0.035149890929460526,0.032277513295412064,0.02642214298248291,-0.1106775552034378,-0.042919233441352844,-0.0455867163836956,-0.17508922517299652,0.028585685417056084,0.08930730819702148,0.03618337959051132,-0.001471039024181664,0.06203989312052727,-0.047379959374666214,-0.003750328905880451,-0.009488556534051895,-0.01731729507446289,0.03192244842648506,0.05270808935165405,0.03330589085817337,-0.06728488206863403,0.0014842540258541703,-0.048447392880916595,0.04504862055182457,0.010377808474004269,0.011116577312350273,0.04749859869480133,-0.06579570472240448,0.0844636857509613,-0.03876171633601189,-0.1301504373550415,-0.06171287223696709,-0.02000265382230282,-0.08200784772634506,-0.012104555033147335,-0.015431972220540047,-0.05074070766568184,0.11417190730571747,-0.010296900756657124,-0.09656111150979996,0.061963848769664764,-0.04013701528310776,0.04503120109438896,-0.0013411169638857245,0.08126696944236755,-0.12774012982845306,-0.09920227527618408,0.024615874513983727,-0.04939529672265053,-0.04408452287316322,0.012131849303841591,-0.0022554676979780197,-0.029110927134752274,0.03932587802410126,0.029970822855830193,0.010079236701130867,0.006204542703926563,0.05219712853431702,-0.017700189724564552,0.011858268640935421,-0.05116572231054306,-0.013307337649166584,-0.016708308830857277,-0.027975989505648613,-0.057731740176677704,0.036709509789943695,-0.04720628261566162,0.014713188633322716,0.012436609715223312,-0.030751796439290047,0.015389030799269676,-0.04849307984113693,0.023909341543912888,-0.0017601435538381338,0.02532326802611351,0.04848076403141022,-0.020467838272452354,0.08034433424472809,-0.05636255815625191,-0.02719828672707081,0.07754693180322647,1.702269001598264e-33,0.07428140193223953,0.04114346206188202,0.05646459013223648,0.16288354992866516,0.06457763910293579,0.06168593466281891,-0.03574676066637039,0.010056419298052788,-0.07453197985887527,-0.024786263704299927,0.05905148759484291,0.06947217136621475,0.034527815878391266,0.11012423783540726,0.01686461828649044,0.05380280315876007,0.031693197786808014,-0.04819966107606888,0.01645251177251339,-0.011324266903102398,-0.037792570888996124,-0.0326671227812767,-0.012728534638881683,-0.0512876957654953,0.028272682800889015,0.06957019865512848,-0.030521001666784286,-5.1805378461722285e-05,-0.045843370258808136,0.04359127953648567,0.014940331690013409,-0.0030489431228488684,-0.011551054194569588,0.0007360285380855203,0.07048768550157547,0.029084522277116776,0.009931250475347042,-0.060700226575136185,0.02385469153523445,0.004972370341420174,0.04211628437042236,-0.01313108205795288,-0.01459411159157753,-0.0022970482241362333,-0.061621468514204025,0.03940330445766449,-0.006475446745753288,0.03256133571267128,0.052549153566360474,0.045090366154909134,-0.0594041533768177,0.05788656696677208,-0.07082787156105042,-0.11562284082174301,0.04100731387734413,0.029372693970799446,0.07128886133432388,0.00403499836102128,0.006084961351007223,-0.05089321359992027,0.039334822446107864,0.0034701472613960505,0.03659624233841896,0.005497985053807497,0.03277778998017311,-0.023880986496806145,0.0228717140853405,0.00018579616153147072,-0.09804782271385193,-0.09179099649190903,-0.1054338738322258,0.026987619698047638,-0.09525596350431442,-0.06656079739332199,-0.010761141777038574,0.04847489669919014,-0.002699117874726653,-0.041771139949560165,-0.09992631524801254,0.001761527848429978,-0.06613238155841827,-0.03005533665418625,-0.020073214545845985,-0.0427868515253067,-0.0945369303226471,-0.05368712916970253,-0.007767834234982729,-0.051443979144096375,0.03551409766077995,0.023816823959350586,-0.012860937044024467,-0.03608337789773941,0.03011656366288662,-0.09525850415229797,-0.10131355375051498,-3.884710915118124e-33,-0.10099200159311295,-0.026337457820773125,0.03648621216416359,0.010165547020733356,-0.01166335865855217,-0.1517101377248764,-0.03252819553017616,0.05591868609189987,0.05598409101366997,-0.0065215048380196095,-0.0645070225000381

While Paganel's absent-mindedness and tendency to get into unusual situations are established, the novel does not depict him as engaging in covert investigations or being involved in violent altercations. The knowledge graph does not contain any information about Paganel's involvement in such activities. Ayrton's betrayal is a major plot point, but Paganel is not involved in uncovering it.
Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: Introducing a secret meeting and a violent encounter alters the established narrative. Paganel's character is not portrayed as a spy or someone who would actively seek out and confront criminals. His role is primarily that of a geographer and scholar, providing geographical interpretations and occasionally making comical errors. This backstory adds a dimension to his character that is not supported by the canon.
Lens 3: Additional Information: While the backstory adds new details, it contradicts the established character and narrative. Therefore, it is not simply adding non-conflicting information.

Adversarial Check: The backstory introduces a significant event that would likely have been mentioned in the novel if it had occurred.

24,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory states that Thalcave handled canoe, coast, and jungle with equal ease, preparing him for a berth on the Dartmouth. However, the canonical text describes Thalcave as a Patagonian guide of the Pampas, an expert horseman and hunter proficient with bolas, lasso, and carbine. His expertise lies in the South American Pampas, not coastal or jungle environments. The novel does not mention any experience with canoes or coastal navigation. This contradicts his established expertise.

Lens 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY: The novel focuses on Thalcave's role as a guide across the Pampas. Introducing a prior history of coastal and jungle navigation, and service on a British ship (Dartmouth), would significantly alter his established character and expertise, making his sudden appearance and specialized knowledge of the Pampas less plausible.

Lens 3: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: While the backstory adds new details, it contradicts Thalcave's established expertise and role in the novel.

ADVERSARIAL CHECK: The backstory introduces skills and experiences (canoe handling, coastal navigation, service on a British ship) that are not only absent from the canonical text but also inconsistent with Thalcave's established role as a Pampas

25,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory states that Napoleon's triumph at Waterloo ended Noirtier's hopes. However, Napoleon did not triumph at Waterloo; he was defeated. This is a factual error. However, the backstory then states that in 1815 he withdrew from active plotting and turned to family affairs. This is plausible, as the defeat at Waterloo occurred in 1815. Therefore, the first part of the sentence is incorrect, but the second part is plausible. 
Lens 2: The backstory does not violate any narrative constraints. It is plausible that Noirtier, after the defeat of Napoleon, would withdraw from active plotting and turn to family affairs. This does not contradict any established events or character traits.
Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information about Noirtier's life after Waterloo, which is not explicitly covered in the novel. This information is consistent with his character and the events of the time.
Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It is a plausible addition to Noirtier's history.",1,0.0100553622469306,0.002790149301290512,0.0100553622469306,-0.00503844628110528,0.023463016375899315,0.09209730476140976,-0.07121202349662781,0.028577568009495735,0.0434141643345356,0.05266888067126274,0.07174176722764969,-0.010961052030324936,-0.012199648655951023,0.008741934783756733,0.019552255049347878,-0.005925288423895836,-0.04984981566667557,0.04446139186620712,0.00460866978392005,-0.03388189524412155,-0.03565330430865288,-0.0018615889130160213,0.03487882390618324,0.008123932406306267,-0.03802494332194328,0.0032274494878947735,-0.04138210788369179,0.046448368579149246,0.08006785064935684,0.03527534008026123,-0.08472878485918045,-0.03425166755914688,-0.015604293905198574,0.061459388583898544,-0.11539115756750107,-0.05490797013044357,-0.05493871495127678,0.01674196682870388,-0.06899067014455795,-0.01781555823981762,0.023317299783229828,-0.003789335722103715,0.01667623594403267,0.012308361940085888,0.03761430084705353,-0.015473456121981144,0.04980336129665375,0.02833237685263157,-0.020228149369359016,0.012577920220792294,-0.10799268633127213,0.060371000319719315,0.10171955078840256,-0.0002563329180702567,0.005748918745666742,-0.08342891186475754,-0.05037342756986618,0.016820397228002548,0.0048353648744523525,0.021562473848462105,0.07576655596494675,0.08097020536661148,0.051104586571455,0.005774798337370157,0.05010445788502693,0.006815166678279638,-0.05127474293112755,0.010973837226629257,-0.024308480322360992,-0.027817318215966225,0.014502134174108505,0.030624540522694588,0.10080181062221527,-0.03940235450863838,0.01628180779516697,-0.055791888386011124,-0.05490295588970184,-0.037172939628362656,-0.020539607852697372,-0.003157086670398712,0.05057613179087639,-0.03912438079714775,-0.0016573501052334905,-0.050723955035209656,0.02366434969007969,0.0038162479177117348,0.01958506554365158,-0.019161393865942955,-0.09041314572095871,0.09044406563043594,-0.01817256584763527,0.15406610071659088,-0.01113076414912939,-0.044003427028656006,-0.06575551629066467,0.07140592485666275,0.015690449625253677,-0.0720147117972374,0.02678462490439415,-0.047316741198301315,0.008379749953746796,-0.019760925322771072,0.03213277459144592,-0.05296425521373749,-0.005810258910059929,-0.007207547314465046,0.012939348816871643,-0.01672828011214733,0.06477048248052597,-0.050568725913763046,-0.01421283558011055,0.0005431192112155259,0.003960078116506338,0.011083503253757954,-0.029464153572916985,0.04114717245101929,0.05013035237789154,0.06866683065891266,0.10825350880622864,-0.07137942314147949,-0.07975929975509644,0.008202551864087582,0.07958248257637024,0.030243119224905968,0.04013879597187042,0.028733309358358383,0.054652586579322815,-0.006100804544985294,0.018598871305584908,0.06586882472038269,-2.9294197169834675e-33,-0.06067648157477379,-0.05822160467505455,-0.04352591559290886,0.07231543213129044,-0.09163383394479752,-0.000396916875615716,-0.10277529805898666,0.016967006027698517,-0.0369424931704998,0.006503582000732422,0.047663912177085876,0.10241134464740753,-0.021789710968732834,0.009977418929338455,-0.05791718140244484,-0.01929837092757225,0.07241236418485641,0.07477138936519623,0.07681091874837875,0.05701545998454094,-0.01902647316455841,0.02384163625538349,0.03329293802380562,0.005851509515196085,-0.04678041487932205,0.01965389959514141,-0.05318913981318474,-0.0061986567452549934,-0.08495788276195526,0.0012514746049419045,-0.011116615496575832,0.011892503127455711,-0.0029206429608166218,0.03151259571313858,-0.035472434014081955,-0.02145620808005333,0.014377148821949959,-0.022571349516510963,0.04743427783250809,0.05617434158921242,-0.07630126178264618,-0.0341557152569294,-0.022913413122296333,0.09831109642982483,0.011927648447453976,-0.08685636520385742,0.024636810645461082,-0.05871718004345894,0.04915640503168106,-0.03286704793572426,-0.01802670769393444,-0.06281254440546036,0.019747037440538406,-0.01634608767926693,0.03409428521990776,0.0416354276239872,-0.022535625845193863,0.07060715556144714,0.063764289021492,-0.033027034252882004,0.0417088121175766,-0.05237604305148125,-0.00620161322876811,0.03925841674208641,-0.044605523347854614,-0.001517861383035779,0.04453536868095398,-0.001494640950113535,-0.07950574904680252,-0.021200183779001236,-0.09622107446193695,0.018766768276691437,-0.03807329013943672,-0.13073399662971497,0.03160398453474045,0.04516759142279625,-0.04411349818110466,0.018949775025248528,-0.06652668118476868,0.034282833337783813,0.010830500163137913,-0.0740734115242958,-0.09305649995803833,-0.032325685024261475,0.032791316509246826,0.018077952787280083,0.06787692755460739,-0.10327818989753723,-0.06312041729688644,0.04825785011053085,-0.03235715255141258,-0.015040285885334015,-0.04203040152788162,0.07305001467466354,0.040480777621269226,1.1810924589970863e-33,0.05756178870797157,-0.0004513293970376253,0.028773782774806023,0.0086361737921834,0.028903447091579437,-0.022250929847359657,0.09543441981077194,-0.0030763621907681227,-0.032987553626298904,0.0933803841471672,-0.025779027491807938,-0.0335851

However, the canonical text states that Glenarvan's expedition met Thalcave on the eastern slope of the Andes after the rescue of Robert Grant. This contradicts the backstory's claim that they met in London. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

Lens 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY: If Glenarvan had already hired Thalcave in London, it would be illogical for the narrative to present their meeting in South America as a chance encounter and for Thalcave to be introduced as a guide who offers his services at that point.

27,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel mentions Noirtier's revolutionary past and his involvement in the trial of Louis XVI is plausible. There is no mention of his specific stance on procedural justice, so this does not contradict any known facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It provides a possible motivation for his later insistence on legal formalism, which aligns with his character. The novel does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It expands on his revolutionary past and provides a plausible explanation for his later views on legal matters. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical novel.

28,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction: The backstory suggests Ayrton was seeking a pardon by trading information about an illicit land deal. However, the canonical narrative establishes that Ayrton's primary motivation was to seize the *Duncan* for piratical purposes. While he does negotiate with Lord Glenarvan to avoid being turned over to British authorities, this negotiation is focused on revealing information about Captain Grant's whereabouts in exchange for exile rather than imprisonment, not a pardon for an illicit land deal. The backstory introduces a new motivation that is not supported by the canonical text and potentially contradicts his established goal of piracy. Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: The novel's plot does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen, but it does shift the focus of Ayrton's character from a pirate to someone seeking a pardon, which is a significant change in motivation. Lens 3: Additional Information: While the backstory adds new details, it introduces a new motivation that is not consistent with the established narrative. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

29,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not mention Noirtier's parents or his early life in detail. Therefore, there are no factual contradictions.

Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Noirtier was influenced by his parents' values, and this influence could have shaped his later political beliefs and actions. The backstory does not violate character agency, introduce supernatural elements, or break any causal chains.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Noirtier's upbringing. It expands on his background and provides a possible explanation for his republicanism and his ability to balance reason with feeling. This information enriches the character's history without contradicting the canon.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines, create impossible coincidences, or give the character knowledge/skills he shouldn't have. It is a plausible and consistent addition to his character history.",1,0.0009807273745536804,0.003271648893132806,0.0009807273745536804,0.06753294914960861,-0.009722413495182991,-0.07135497033596039,-0.03891981765627861,0.09187504649162292,0.041764602065086365,0.12263025343418121,-0.0027005511801689863,-0.026758378371596336,-0.010711670853197575,0.05372842401266098,-0.027662115171551704,-0.007848117500543594,-0.08402930945158005,0.00463121896609664,0.05138597637414932,0.05509430915117264,-0.01616969145834446,-0.058680854737758636,0.08594201505184174,-0.14044035971164703,-0.058264996856451035,0.03740277886390686,-0.008287418633699417,0.005512850824743509,0.06742698699235916,0.053596630692481995,0.02124822326004505,0.061364442110061646,-0.030827999114990234,0.06527329981327057,0.009706438519060612,-0.06556243449449539,0.059222761541604996,-0.02315022237598896,0.04014847055077553,-0.022624613717198372,0.06067614629864693,0.0787871778011322,0.01564900390803814,0.04288362339138985,-0.01825457066297531,0.005088884849101305,-0.06909679621458054,0.06147674471139908,-0.03419732302427292,-0.005804067477583885,0.034350715577602386,0.07667780667543411,-0.02597372606396675,-0.002327533671632409,-0.003740904154255986,-0.0635397881269455,-0.08271344006061554,-0.04961325600743294,0.08729564398527145,0.0876922458410263,0.0971541777253151,-0.03106195479631424,0.009619651362299919,-0.022469764575362206,-0.004964872263371944,-0.03612711653113365,-0.007084850687533617,0.015096446499228477,0.003713645040988922,0.0824243426322937,-0.008377722464501858,-0.08873088657855988,0.023647401481866837,-0.04340917617082596,0.10362537205219269,0.00992617942392826,-0.04983934760093689,-0.04513531178236008,-0.04811699688434601,-0.026871265843510628,0.042779114097356796,0.014615903608500957,-0.04597949609160423,-0.047502551227808,0.024336565285921097,-0.07055168598890305,0.07126238197088242,-0.0036281682550907135,-0.03787284344434738,0.073259636759758,-0.04998398199677467,0.047010429203510284,0.05208069831132889,-0.016154788434505463,-0.11688084900379181,-0.018076729029417038,0.014179135672748089,-0.09906559437513351,0.01512980554252863,-0.056587349623441696,0.012701376341283321,-0.08842471241950989,0.0372077152132988,-0.044630374759435654,0.029318923130631447,-0.002907711314037442,0.09426175802946091,0.009882238693535328,-0.05846046283841133,-0.02737298607826233,-0.006606698967516422,0.011717352084815502,-0.004253820050507784,-0.0683068037033081,-0.05129300802946091,0.028168529272079468,-0.02425347827374935,0.08210542798042297,0.05042493715882301,0.022871438413858414,-0.035354673862457275,-0.051785774528980255,-0.009338128380477428,0.025202613323926926,0.09076301753520966,-0.1053951233625412,0.06435251981019974,-0.07453159242868423,-0.09761392325162888,-0.0396898090839386,-2.0126494687252577e-33,-0.0726841613650322,-0.005594995338469744,0.0230366550385952,0.038704968988895416,-0.014291663654148579,0.046111099421978,-0.04379727318882942,-0.0025222788099199533,-0.05218006670475006,-0.01822667010128498,-0.0024845367297530174,-0.0140288220718503,0.012884210795164108,-0.00046103252680040896,-0.07664809376001358,0.023871585726737976,-0.18301516771316528,-0.0022777370177209377,0.10006888955831528,0.004771687090396881,-0.07960057258605957,0.0563884936273098,-0.04155667871236801,-0.030713334679603577,-0.008121632039546967,-0.08044853061437607,0.04877014830708504,0.044869594275951385,-0.07892324775457382,-0.0001114593687816523,-0.0665571391582489,0.08745395392179489,-0.0032296834979206324,0.022081980481743813,0.0695057138800621,-0.0014280916657298803,0.004343028180301189,-0.027675708755850792,0.05903637409210205,-0.010838264599442482,-0.029848704114556313,0.03621339052915573,0.018959054723381996,-0.008520896546542645,0.004736493807286024,0.05994267761707306,0.048840299248695374,-0.09658321738243103,-0.005324955098330975,-0.0021212799474596977,0.006067547015845776,-0.026597103103995323,0.045381516218185425,-0.05189448967576027,-0.033813588321208954,0.014860671013593674,-0.06502177566289902,0.10101606696844101,-0.03796594589948654,-0.0356421172618866,-0.010679138824343681,-0.03393762931227684,0.02320796065032482,0.027056589722633362,-0.0981544479727745,-0.0029738498851656914,-0.05602438375353813,0.03353198990225792,0.004362867679446936,-0.04115861654281616,-0.07150489091873169,-0.018676411360502243,-0.012620155699551105,-0.04435179382562637,-0.016572101041674614,0.005948794540017843,-0.002368980087339878,0.01928029954433441,-0.009839709848165512,-0.06904523074626923,-0.03512285649776459,0.046925392001867294,0.05958319082856178,0.049405746161937714,-0.017865601927042007,-0.004965099040418863,0.02878623642027378,-0.10316833108663559,-0.0009484852198511362,0.06323650479316711,0.011439143680036068,-0.0880061537027359,0.02110479027032852,-0.08635248988866806,-0.06159953027963638,-1.3576865161436378e-33,-0.005278903059661388,-0.026707002893090248,-0.0009507112554274499,0.07334952801465988,0.07116624712944031,-0.09819398820400238,-0.06373991072177887,0.010939935222268105,0.05056899040937424,-0.014690648764371872,-0.020

30,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There is no direct contradiction. The backstory does not introduce any impossible events or timelines. Faria and Noirtier could have plausibly studied together in Rome. The novel does not explicitly state they *didn't* know each other. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It doesn't violate character agency or introduce supernatural elements. It provides a possible reason for Faria's political leanings and Noirtier's involvement in politics. It doesn't break any causal chains. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new information that enriches Faria's history without contradicting the canon.

31,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There is no direct contradiction with the canonical text. The backstory does not introduce any events that are explicitly stated not to have happened. The canonical text does not provide a detailed account of Faria's activities before his imprisonment, leaving room for this backstory. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Faria is established as a political thinker and advocate for Italian unification. Supporting constitutionalist movements in other countries aligns with his character and political beliefs. The claim that he was branded a Jacobin plotter and fled pursuit is also plausible given the political climate of the time. This backstory does not violate any narrative constraints or create any paradoxes with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich Faria's history. It provides a possible reason for his imprisonment and explains his political leanings. It fills a gap in the narrative without breaking established facts. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical

32,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not explicitly state how Ayrton arrived in Australia, only that he claimed to have been washed overboard. This backstory provides an alternative explanation for his arrival. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Ayrton, suspected of colluding with the enemy, would panic and flee. This does not create a paradox with later events, as it simply explains his presence in Australia. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It provides a possible reason for Ayrton's presence in Australia, which is not explicitly detailed in the novel.

33,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not explicitly state whether Noirtier desired domestic peace or had specific hopes for Villefort's future.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details by providing internal motivations for Noirtier's actions and feelings towards his family.

The strained relationship with Villefort is already established, and this backstory provides a possible reason for Noirtier's initial hopes for his

34,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Abbé Faria. The novel does not mention the source of his invisible ink formula or his activities before his imprisonment. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It provides a potential origin for Faria's knowledge of chemistry and secret writing, which he demonstrates in the novel. It does not violate any narrative constraints or create any paradoxes with later events. The novel does not require that Faria did NOT have experience with restoring temple murals or using invisible ink for rescuing epics. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Faria's past. It enriches his character by suggesting a possible motivation for his intellectual pursuits and his desire to help others. It provides a plausible explanation for his skills and knowledge.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Faria knowledge or skills he shouldn't have, as he demonstrates expertise in these areas within the novel.",1,0.0017790028359740973,0.0005071995547041297,0.0017790028359740973,-0.05897439643740654,0.04243558645248413,-0.03744283318519592,0.03498087078332901,0.031066562980413437,0.014773705042898655,0.061535049229860306,-0.033159978687763214,0.02772681415081024,0.009235345758497715,0.054025910794734955,0.019199782982468605,0.0029483872931450605,0.009052273817360401,-0.08446690440177917,-0.0014458777150139213,-0.039746351540088654,-0.016011951491236687,0.011583099141716957,-0.017376696690917015,0.11095736920833588,-0.0014089462347328663,-0.02982613630592823,-0.02392699010670185,0.1529114544391632,0.07155170291662216,0.0061620199121534824,-0.03672894835472107,0.13787686824798584,-0.03614586219191551,0.019352927803993225,-0.03205471113324165,0.004442301113158464,-0.012291603721678257,0.015348250977694988,0.0014684522757306695,0.004394418094307184,0.08787476271390915,0.03838079422712326,-0.06521419435739517,0.02554347552359104,0.03546498715877533,-0.0031200521625578403,-0.03298894688487053,0.005266570020467043,-0.011169067583978176,-0.0311451219022274,0.0446142852306366,-0.0049262684769928455,-0.02059384249150753,0.03301858901977539,-0.022162457928061485,-0.052466366440057755,-0.06358683109283447,0.10232210159301758,-0.06329312175512314,-0.0019193554762750864,-0.05246194452047348,0.009042520076036453,-0.036203525960445404,0.00697907991707325,0.032602474093437195,0.01651655323803425,0.07094284147024155,-0.011970696970820427,-0.0035469597205519676,0.006161971483379602,-0.040198490023612976,0.055563222616910934,0.023979468271136284,0.034865785390138626,0.052056681364774704,0.04129260033369064,-0.05586438253521919,-0.006005955394357443,0.008887523785233498,-0.025526484474539757,0.053683504462242126,-0.12392458319664001,0.00964439194649458,0.04994695633649826,0.002521888120099902,0.05468009412288666,0.15189823508262634,-0.04933936521410942,0.11037559062242508,-0.02482784353196621,-0.07012245059013367,0.04644269496202469,-0.030797110870480537,0.11227641999721527,0.03578490763902664,-0.031576525419950485,0.017969736829400063,-0.022697318345308304,-0.07696929574012756,0.031118664890527725,0.058061566203832626,0.042479258030653,0.04918515309691429,0.01601269282400608,-0.030890485271811485,0.012688547372817993,-0.07398287206888199,-0.010042965412139893,-0.05156024545431137,-0.06479757279157639,-0.044275470077991486,0.02170405350625515,0.01065625436604023,0.009172098711133003,-0.05066177621483803,-0.022059904411435127,0.07210563123226166,-0.08808375149965286,-0.001294457819312811,-0.020249074324965477,-0.05042417719960213,0.0010754821123555303,0.0556652806699276,0.01740741729736328,0.01685977354645729,0.00027032659272663295,-0.00496647460386157,-0.10685323178768158,0.06045929342508316,-0.05986723303794861,-1.7743925595189192e-33,-0.0011811411241069436,0.059971828013658524,-0.01229748036712408,-0.03498542308807373,0.05738434940576553,-0.03957800939679146,0.024408863857388496,-0.10518886148929596,0.01211855560541153,-0.09100370109081268,0.04163467511534691,0.031676217913627625,0.017967067658901215,0.09542389214038849,-0.038988322019577026,0.03710823133587837,-0.011148553341627121,-0.061189599335193634,-0.016335709020495415,-0.07284952700138092,-0.08024673908948898,-0.0037419998552650213,0.05055186152458191,-0.0020363808143883944,-0.008724591694772243,0.12777414917945862,-0.010045487433671951,-0.016624009236693382,0.018623899668455124,0.05270763486623764,0.01341545395553112,0.09527143836021423,-0.040034495294094086,-0.02202950045466423,-0.022978397086262703,0.04585668072104454,0.027883255854249,-0.16776973009109497,-0.07271643728017807,0.13147518038749695,0.005713524296879768,0.04190870746970177,0.03172904625535011,-0.0037142131477594376,0.0210037212818861,-0.018589181825518608,-0.04596463590860367,0.07761654257774353,0.025928450748324394,0.09679306298494339,-0.03620258346199989,0.10893724858760834,-0.0033926658798009157,-0.1613212674856186,-0.051920026540756226,-0.02933645248413086,0.024290764704346657,-0.025678925216197968,-0.005655588116496801,-0.027814559638500214,-0.04722512885928154,-0.005510997027158737,0.0745786502957344,0.10462640970945358,-0.018410155549645424,0.03849701210856438,-0.055639903992414474,-0.03464226797223091,-0.015974735841155052,-0.0737183690071106,-0.04371137171983719,0.02792414091527462,-0.017717130482196808,-0.06263014674186707,-0.02830052189528942,-0.0009849470807239413,-0.035861581563949585,-0.035888344049453735,-0.02527213655412197,0.0035168679896742105,-0.15457837283611298,-0.00015006301691755652,-0.07507085055112839,-0.08110515028238297,-0.012153415009379387,-0.010987985879182816,0.08496725559234619,-0.003774796612560749,-0.03159546107053757,-0.03608948737382889,0.06866846978664398,-0.01328941062092781,-0.03646394610404968,-0.08093826472759247,-0.09883499890565872,1.7188199792769972e-35,-0.08942070603370667,0.01553342491388321,-0.03937627747654915,0.07168032974004745,0.0022337164264172316,-0.0474928617477417,-0.04762013629078865,0.07830622047185898,0.11492297798395157,-0.007941492833197117,-

Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Ayrton received a dagger from someone before his criminal activities. This does not violate character agency, tone, or causal chains. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Ayrton's past. It provides a possible origin for his character without contradicting any established facts.

36,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There are no direct factual contradictions. The backstory does not conflict with Kai-Koumou's known traits or actions in the novel. The novel does not provide details about his early life or specific battles he may have been involved in. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It aligns with Kai-Koumou's character as a fierce warrior and leader of his tribe. His cruelty and willingness to sacrifice prisoners are consistent with his canonical description. The acquisition of muskets and learning basic French could explain his possession of an English-made gun. The poisoning attempt and subsequent darkening of his nature provide a plausible origin for his cruelty. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new details that enrich Kai-Koumou's history without contradicting the canon. It provides a possible explanation for his cruelty and his acquisition of weapons. It also adds a layer of complexity to his character by suggesting a past trauma that shaped his

37,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There are no direct contradictions to established canon. The backstory doesn't introduce any impossible events or timelines. The novel doesn't explicitly state how Thalcave learned his skills or developed his understanding of the Pampas. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It aligns with Thalcave's role as a guide and his knowledge of the Pampas. It provides a reasonable explanation for his expertise and his dedication to helping others survive in the harsh environment. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It enriches Thalcave's history by providing a possible origin for his skills and motivations. It explains how he gained knowledge of water sources and developed a sense of duty as a guide. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical

38,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. The novel does not mention the specific circumstances of Paganel's life before the voyage, so there is no factual contradiction. 

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Paganel's absent-mindedness and tendency to make errors are central to his character. A head injury that causes him to mix up dates and directions would provide a plausible origin for these traits. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, and accepting it does not create a paradox with later events.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich the character's history. It provides a possible explanation for Paganel's absent-mindedness and tendency to make errors, which are defining traits of his character. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canon.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Paganel knowledge or skills he shouldn't have.",1,0.9386407732963562,0.004447817336767912,0.9386407732963562,0.010133814997971058,0.1234472244977951,0.04205300658941269,0.017774146050214767,0.05511423572897911,-0.003962003625929356,-0.019180839881300926,-0.05500661954283714,-0.006241863593459129,0.05453268438577652,0.0662231296300888,-0.0671820268034935,0.014503566548228264,-0.025155844166874886,-0.06839436292648315,-0.06583293527364731,-0.05724732205271721,-0.00035449606366455555,0.002289438620209694,0.018434032797813416,-0.057831380516290665,0.1386345475912094,-0.018997544422745705,-0.026784298941493034,0.0019136137561872602,0.0521116629242897,-0.047473832964897156,-0.005008493550121784,0.020123235881328583,-0.03678712993860245,0.10704328864812851,0.08289453387260437,-0.0906437560915947,0.01066546980291605,-0.02360428124666214,0.0004467772087082267,-0.015896141529083252,0.10254352539777756,0.029382485896348953,0.07516452670097351,-0.06288290023803711,-0.010318310000002384,0.05939534679055214,-0.05000006780028343,-0.02763078548014164,0.02072589285671711,0.07593675702810287,0.012831331230700016,-0.006048267241567373,0.009216929785907269,-0.006499161012470722,-0.01348489336669445,-0.06345855444669724,-0.16037829220294952,-0.04153865575790405,-0.04358197748661041,0.034519728273153305,0.011743741109967232,0.006189478095620871,0.039023056626319885,-0.030980225652456284,0.03260355442762375,-0.04525220766663551,-0.00408750306814909,0.08754584938287735,-0.02466578781604767,0.05589456111192703,-0.013469943776726723,0.08282991498708725,0.05171309411525726,0.06574063748121262,0.05111319199204445,-0.001785981934517622,-0.08295999467372894,-0.0047768657095730305,-0.00469180615618825,-0.03447134792804718,0.03269840031862259,0.02132626250386238,-0.11523101478815079,-0.040461283177137375,-0.0013225408038124442,0.02382318675518036,-0.0242049228399992,0.016289228573441505,0.010859061032533646,0.044496092945337296,0.09138065576553345,-0.015521591529250145,0.0038482355885207653,0.10285390913486481,-0.03099741041660309,0.04997937008738518,0.07650966942310333,0.011643685400485992,-0.027852818369865417,-0.007804408203810453,0.054709069430828094,0.04339560121297836,0.07205065339803696,0.06102445349097252,-0.06118122115731239,-0.1523607224225998,0.0326155461370945,-0.01646505482494831,-0.0157297533005476,-0.028985528275370598,-0.07344871759414673,-0.08654380589723587,0.006959144026041031,-0.004408873617649078,-0.011581783182919025,-0.08245069533586502,-0.07191845029592514,0.02601020038127899,-0.030540015548467636,0.029408346861600876,-0.04725198820233345,-0.05781358852982521,-0.05533561110496521,0.028424859046936035,-0.08866288512945175,0.01098430436104536,0.010492125526070595,0.0356687493622303,0.0695544183254242,0.09306193888187408,-4.6493901941371765e-33,0.11291530728340149,-0.011398384347558022,-0.039152439683675766,0.011221063323318958,0.06485303491353989,0.08067294210195541,-0.06442976742982864,0.06782686710357666,0.04953167587518692,0.07160627096891403,-0.033626627177000046,0.06258783489465714,0.060057949274778366,0.021368203684687614,-0.09173763543367386,0.0009596005547791719,-0.06485972553491592,-0.02422443777322769,-0.08393595367670059,-0.04526842013001442,-0.05901891365647316,-0.0878223329782486,0.018928827717900276,0.01730777882039547,0.07687179744243622,0.07377607375383377,0.00957630854099989,-0.020629268139600754,-0.058147791773080826,0.025162920355796814,-0.010129201225936413,-0.015460223890841007,0.007464104797691107,0.0008956429664976895,0.061887260526418686,0.14074918627738953,-0.016935721039772034,-0.06843624264001846,-0.04342393949627876,0.03955981880426407,0.1112733855843544,-0.03420273959636688,-0.013313304632902145,-0.020883308723568916,0.06454914808273315,-0.015130249783396721,-0.10617583990097046,0.03896566107869148,0.008724004030227661,-0.06765244156122208,0.006924865767359734,0.029223399236798286,0.05252497270703316,-0.05387406051158905,0.0054563721641898155,0.0697106122970581,-0.08367109298706055,0.0016380014130845666,0.08801421523094177,0.05667475610971451,0.10396090894937515,0.00028877126169390976,0.0065425387583673,0.007310386281460524,0.023645060136914253,0.07211467623710632,-0.013681972399353981,0.02834499441087246,-0.019125670194625854,-0.047184690833091736,-0.0293894000351429,0.0027380448300391436,0.0020398679189383984,0.02207592874765396,-0.08560562133789062,0.03797784447669983,-0.049537766724824905,0.0829639881849289,0.02936922013759613,-0.02096654660999775,-0.08277634531259537,0.06225331127643585,0.042233843356370926,-0.038819923996925354,-0.09399969130754471,0.04552469030022621,0.04939514026045799,0.04652050882577896,-0.06379637867212296,0.0012590775731950998,-0.011017016135156155,0.05715864896774292,0.04209413751959801,-0.08757272362709045,0.042633846402168274,1.0333262069430014e-33,-0.08687267452478409,0.027780985459685326,-0.10553114116191864,0.027947308495640755,0.02109791524708271,-0.027639314532279968,0.022672448307275772,0.038263142108917236,-0.0062277610413730145,0.004517126362770796,-0.00581902964040637,-0.02852826379239559

39,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONTRADICTING,"LENS 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory states that after his discharge, Ayrton adopted the alias Ben Joyce. However, the canonical text indicates that Ayrton was already known as Ben Joyce, the leader of escaped convicts, before his employment on the *Britannia*. He used the alias Tom Ayrton to conceal his true identity and infiltrate Lord Glenarvan's expedition. This contradicts the backstory's claim that he adopted the alias *after* a discharge. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

40,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The canonical text does not mention Paganel's early life or career before his geographical studies in Paris. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It is reasonable to assume that Paganel, who speaks both French and English, could have served in a merchant fleet and learned basic seamanship and celestial navigation. This experience would not contradict his later career as a geographer. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Paganel's life before he became a geographer. It provides a possible explanation for his linguistic abilities and adds a layer to his character without contradicting any established facts.",1,0.5388121008872986,0.02523634023964405,0.5388121008872986,0.06627722829580307,0.01969027705490589,0.005763793829828501,-0.029259296134114265,-0.018085729330778122,-0.015996478497982025,0.09386876225471497,-0.015309957787394524,-0.01667102985084057,0.0018335579661652446,0.007398173213005066,-0.017540330067276955,-0.005022573750466108,0.012466374784708023,-0.05031302571296692,-0.014602849259972572,-0.04070392623543739,-0.01598585583269596,-0.0040260604582726955,-0.0038938657380640507,-0.019392557442188263,0.07637840509414673,0.018605941906571388,0.012774527072906494,0.010473426431417465,-0.006944683846086264,0.015320328064262867,-0.011932110413908958,0.061618622392416,0.03526303917169571,0.02162967249751091,0.10251948237419128,0.02967817522585392,0.049578599631786346,-0.08340218663215637,0.01853870041668415,0.05341868847608566,0.00314849684946239,-0.04802565276622772,-0.031068431213498116,-0.05806596577167511,-0.016942806541919708,0.016142018139362335,0.11052984744310379,-0.04053683951497078,-0.06876709312200546,-0.02828286774456501,0.030956147238612175,0.07239754498004913,0.04694467782974243,-0.09305716305971146,-0.003474676748737693,-0.006891265977174044,-0.13142625987529755,-0.05875549465417862,0.036987997591495514,-0.04447200521826744,0.08111441135406494,0.013382094912230968,-0.06786438077688217,-0.013964285142719746,0.022403057664632797,-0.005250690970569849,0.04540543258190155,-0.010426335036754608,-0.06606564670801163,0.013128132559359074,-0.0018253031885251403,-0.09334562718868256,0.03775252029299736,-0.027436718344688416,-0.03734230622649193,0.059317782521247864,0.013546559028327465,0.017388565465807915,-0.06079830229282379,0.011913622729480267,-0.0066141486167907715,-0.033172376453876495,-0.05620250478386879,-0.016520757228136063,0.016166817396879196,-0.0813768208026886,0.04179459065198898,0.05402504652738571,-0.044640351086854935,0.045929450541734695,-0.053396955132484436,0.02238575369119644,0.014336638152599335,0.09756960719823837,-0.11693083494901657,0.01739495061337948,0.009406568482518196,-0.061473503708839417,-0.003554747672751546,-0.07620757818222046,0.11963048577308655,-0.06482148170471191,0.03125439211726189,0.06342536956071854,-0.0020535376388579607,0.04120967164635658,0.07565247267484665,-0.14004087448120117,-0.008846856653690338,0.013055430725216866,-5.8289409935241565e-05,0.04408431798219681,-0.0931217297911644,-0.06611140072345734,0.013126435689628124,-0.0275286752730608,-0.011318682692945004,-0.02006908878684044,0.10862657427787781,-0.04124089702963829,-0.07000423967838287,-0.017763501033186913,-0.03848901018500328,-0.031073467805981636,0.024385938420891762,0.00028509675757959485,0.004560376051813364,-0.0652407556772232,0.010925845243036747,0.11131390929222107,-1.0839395039405551e-33,0.06949352473020554,0.03962305188179016,0.007516869343817234,0.01038508489727974,0.016602907329797745,0.009390871040523052,-0.016106827184557915,0.02201339416205883,0.04262832552194595,-0.0666235014796257,0.008138032630085945,-0.006600115913897753,0.01450001448392868,0.061935365200042725,-0.06257984787225723,0.10357064753770828,0.03387570008635521,-0.024644427001476288,-0.012126856483519077,-0.09832784533500671,0.06978452950716019,-0.026076633483171463,0.04354080557823181,-0.09842322021722794,0.07384859770536423,0.008697953075170517,0.031072625890374184,-0.002613021759316325,0.029150279238820076,0.08172591775655746,-0.13251568377017975,0.01968309096992016,-0.0012707101413980126,0.02638152986764908,0.03482136130332947,0.038447972387075424,-0.004763834178447723,-0.10895510762929916,-0.008902963250875473,0.027242932468652725,0.07661058753728867,0.05674419552087784,0.0531669482588768,0.055358413606882095,-0.07043113559484482,-0.06705621629953384,-0.0660778060555458,0.0229796115309,0.06720328330993652,0.0900542289018631,-0.005273574497550726,-0.05694349855184555,-0.04830684885382652,-0.05400366336107254,0.0976775512099266,0.09192745387554169,0.008821827359497547,0.09868939220905304,-0.0498199500143528,-0.012724904343485832,-0.05836595594882965,-0.02359423227608204,0.11573217809200287,0.1007484421133995,0.05703940615057945,0.018678702414035797,-0.04331151396036148,0.0024268818087875843,-0.04817141592502594,-0.07217550277709961,-0.022045735269784927,0.028539562597870827,0.04789044335484505,-0.026253217831254005,-0.00442454544827342,0.04807429015636444,-0.025104418396949768,-0.05591217055916786,0.015572195872664452,-0.041390467435121536,-0.09004756063222885,-0.020935725420713425,-0.04782896488904953,0.11029472202062607,-0.05770492926239967,0.012603395618498325,0.06584329903125763,0.018812574446201324,0.04441950470209122,0.01251672487705946,-0.023817531764507294,-0.03298366442322731,0.029266048222780228,-0.1266147941350937,-0.04771873354911804,-1.615322827255724e-33,-0.08089873939752579,0.09924245625734329,-0.06256219744682312,-0.022858820855617523,-0.04946601390838623,-0.043351732194423676,0.06923778355121613,-0.017521284520626068,-0.006926890928298235,-0.020075146108865738,-0.0612122043967247,-0.069938

Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Faria came from a theological family, given his own scholarly pursuits and religious vocation. The backstory does not introduce any elements that would create a paradox with later events or violate character agency.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Faria's family background. It enriches his history by providing a possible origin for his intellectual and linguistic abilities. The backstory is a plausible expansion of Faria's character.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Faria knowledge or skills he shouldn't have.",1,0.9920015335083008,0.0008462192490696907,0.9920015335083008,0.018728885799646378,0.018441786989569664,-0.011325962841510773,0.012307930737733841,-0.10530131310224533,0.012383311055600643,0.034279465675354004,0.009207225404679775,0.002180190524086356,0.013512283563613892,-0.0013591536553576589,-0.06096843257546425,0.017385952174663544,-0.040328025817871094,-0.046500954777002335,0.02338438667356968,-0.05105225741863251,0.046382710337638855,0.0055070905946195126,-0.028088025748729706,-0.009115614928305149,0.03673504665493965,0.07363239675760269,-0.02522747591137886,0.06835175305604935,0.12858912348747253,0.01889823004603386,-0.07077700644731522,0.06062079966068268,0.05105844512581825,-0.03960345685482025,-0.05373057723045349,-0.005538490135222673,-0.028798799961805344,-0.0032998183742165565,0.07402120530605316,-0.02345711924135685,0.09029873460531235,0.04494117945432663,0.01080597285181284,0.03454150632023811,0.09462523460388184,-0.011040630750358105,0.013355443254113197,0.11860022693872452,-0.03087201528251171,0.004825928248465061,0.042933907359838486,0.017907412722706795,0.0684451013803482,-0.045245569199323654,-0.0486936941742897,0.01655321940779686,0.019504891708493233,-0.09554120153188705,0.07274069637060165,-0.028574159368872643,0.10741148889064789,-0.004866813309490681,0.017431968823075294,-0.014959684573113918,-0.011244459077715874,-0.046267956495285034,-0.02626403607428074,-0.03253645822405815,0.021742315962910652,0.07498276978731155,0.003063144627958536,-0.022869175300002098,-0.01781555637717247,0.07504168897867203,0.015888655558228493,0.01619800552725792,0.0929679274559021,-0.03234386071562767,-0.021424053236842155,-0.03813483566045761,0.024469973519444466,-0.1734153777360916,-0.023615462705492973,0.060428377240896225,0.04655257984995842,-0.004566775634884834,0.04357117414474487,-0.08877957612276077,0.03152443841099739,0.034284576773643494,-0.07114557921886444,0.06436452269554138,0.01939948834478855,0.039617035537958145,-0.08572852611541748,-0.030931195244193077,-0.06822749227285385,-0.035227272659540176,-0.04378005117177963,-0.013105430640280247,0.07382702082395554,0.013984075747430325,0.0110419737175107,-3.830527566606179e-05,-0.026836734265089035,0.006235736422240734,0.11679292470216751,-0.015070500783622265,0.048612821847200394,-0.015369417145848274,-0.0591280497610569,-0.04857594147324562,0.010695324279367924,-0.005513472948223352,0.05451205000281334,-0.08776562660932541,0.0046238973736763,0.046234890818595886,0.03460032865405083,0.01722186990082264,-0.011323009617626667,-0.029567889869213104,0.05649261549115181,-0.07405558973550797,0.0254290159791708,0.009703509509563446,0.03349805250763893,-0.08068843930959702,-0.04281046614050865,-0.002477387199178338,-9.596864449807776e-34,-0.026029126718640327,0.013229578733444214,0.0041579995304346085,0.04804520308971405,0.0010947693372145295,0.061103641986846924,0.06416524201631546,-0.03194652870297432,-0.058404773473739624,-0.17870861291885376,-0.04961489140987396,-0.09305664896965027,0.054373834282159805,-0.013277357444167137,-0.07474414259195328,0.06557425111532211,-0.05333707109093666,-0.0473291240632534,0.08609957993030548,-0.024817422032356262,-0.019865218549966812,0.02377953752875328,0.024459166452288628,-0.07828153669834137,0.008845869451761246,0.004523160867393017,0.06129585951566696,-0.07292934507131577,-0.038335420191287994,0.008583489805459976,-0.0534881167113781,0.043851178139448166,0.010110546834766865,-0.06813176721334457,0.03044314868748188,0.07720977067947388,0.011955694295465946,-0.06003263592720032,0.015307554043829441,0.028849350288510323,-0.02841702476143837,0.014533366076648235,0.0665736198425293,-0.016767781227827072,-0.027108222246170044,0.003689635545015335,-0.05624859035015106,-0.03659699112176895,0.029247473925352097,0.003998755477368832,-0.02567107416689396,0.008166844956576824,-0.05625206604599953,0.009162036702036858,0.038830842822790146,0.05893317237496376,-0.0017321896739304066,0.009328347630798817,0.06934265792369843,0.05455200746655464,0.003097397508099675,-0.038164567202329636,0.020867731422185898,0.06523509323596954,-0.018459079787135124,0.001496868091635406,-0.08744978159666061,0.035372521728277206,0.14325761795043945,-0.05411437898874283,-0.024540625512599945,-0.020789479836821556,-0.0531005784869194,-0.04474208131432533,-0.03819825127720833,0.0749664306640625,-0.06326716393232346,-0.03279852122068405,-0.06677097827196121,0.06351473927497864,-0.028178401291370392,-0.017202090471982956,0.056052785366773605,0.051737766712903976,0.013080308213829994,0.0360221303999424,-0.02689824439585209,-0.00034430771484039724,-0.02475915104150772,0.1268775761127472,0.0836682915687561,0.06310822069644928,0.04432016611099243,-0.12173475325107574,-0.04988258704543114,-3.469640324176172e-35,0.017983803525567055,-0.00037458923179656267,0.014533847570419312,0.07953290641307831,-0.07083364576101303,-0.1361413151025772,-0.03699493408203125,0.07569161802530289,0.04426199570298195,0.04400116577744484,-0.005036617629230022,0.0152184404

The ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity are consistent with Faria's political aspirations for a unified Italy and his general character as a learned and hopeful man. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Faria, despite his imprisonment, would find hope in Enlightenment ideals. This does not contradict any later events in the novel. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail by suggesting that Enlightenment ideals sustained him.

43,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Kai-Koumou. His name translating to ""he who eats the limbs of his enemy"" is similar to the backstory's ""Bone-Eater,"" but not contradictory. The backstory does not violate any timelines or relationships. 

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It provides a possible origin for his fierce reputation and leadership. The detail about the crippled leg and peach-wood staff is new, but does not contradict his physical description as a tall man with powerful limbs, as he could still be powerful despite the injury. The backstory does not give Kai-Koumou undue agency or introduce supernatural elements.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new details about Kai-Koumou's past, specifically his actions during the north-island war and the origin of his nickname. This information enriches his character without conflicting with the canonical information.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It provides a plausible explanation for his fierceness and leadership, without giving him knowledge or skills he shouldn't

44,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not provide details about Ayrton's childhood or family background, so there are no factual contradictions. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible and respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It provides a possible explanation for Ayrton's later criminal behavior and his disdain for authority. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, and accepting it does not create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Ayrton's early life, enriching his character's history without contradicting any established facts. It provides a plausible origin for his rebellious nature and criminal tendencies.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Ayrton knowledge or skills he shouldn't have.",1,0.0014964116271585226,0.004939447157084942,0.0014964116271585226,0.01666019670665264,-0.012444579973816872,-0.0938466489315033,0.027503974735736847,0.03483552485704422,0.08026294410228729,0.05868759751319885,0.03568653017282486,-0.07600072771310806,-0.031400587409734726,0.10748768597841263,-0.04567190632224083,0.0012827567989006639,7.254817319335416e-05,-0.10227407515048981,0.049753833562135696,-0.07910772413015366,0.004406418651342392,-0.032182689756155014,0.017952099442481995,-0.07769616693258286,0.008166038431227207,0.0023842512164264917,-0.01626080833375454,0.015215052291750908,0.09769899398088455,0.06893005967140198,0.04767033830285072,0.03232565522193909,0.042092058807611465,0.005614444613456726,0.023090265691280365,-0.027579765766859055,0.03200604394078255,0.009461063891649246,0.004760619718581438,0.11152296513319016,0.037275273352861404,0.03472505509853363,0.017759768292307854,0.034104641526937485,-0.017696507275104523,0.002976756077259779,0.05846206471323967,0.046936098486185074,-0.10653004050254822,0.002704596146941185,-0.017385875806212425,0.06977405399084091,-0.02718118391931057,-0.05899784713983536,-0.03713878616690636,0.04232850670814514,0.02458738163113594,-0.008843683637678623,-0.028032314032316208,0.045317042618989944,0.021651502698659897,-0.023112544789910316,-0.04369552433490753,-0.08542890101671219,0.02279743179678917,0.03196009248495102,-0.02873305231332779,0.0035602280404418707,-0.007381351199001074,-0.01851661503314972,-0.028873227536678314,0.018411345779895782,0.008306852541863918,-0.055815160274505615,-0.008837970905005932,-0.022758562117815018,0.05918107181787491,-0.09828144311904907,-0.003818314988166094,-0.03264058381319046,-0.022346189245581627,-0.06518721580505371,-0.002551429206505418,-0.0381644181907177,-0.030207356438040733,-0.05451454222202301,0.010864467360079288,-0.0035141760017722845,-0.0399545356631279,0.05588828772306442,-0.0810948982834816,0.016885001212358475,0.11620630323886871,-0.02093747816979885,-0.035415295511484146,-0.03727155178785324,-0.007539658807218075,-0.04177365452051163,-0.04282413050532341,0.007719322107732296,0.01645268127322197,-0.09548964351415634,0.03471152111887932,-0.004363791085779667,0.015444113872945309,0.059610333293676376,0.0508442297577858,0.04163996875286102,-0.007314879912883043,-0.022928910329937935,-0.025204883888363838,-0.07481155544519424,-0.05052587389945984,-0.06337282806634903,-0.018475931137800217,-0.06945157796144485,0.01855657249689102,0.0725482851266861,0.04704723134636879,0.012393061071634293,-0.022831708192825317,-0.13604001700878143,-0.054577410221099854,0.06380566954612732,0.09618302434682846,-0.06104862689971924,0.04785439372062683,-0.05965760350227356,0.015574324876070023,0.010155733674764633,1.8592814350765276e-33,-0.02906803786754608,-0.060135066509246826,-0.0053429738618433475,0.08210226893424988,0.038626909255981445,0.05238276347517967,0.003431113436818123,0.0372055359184742,0.027456961572170258,-0.0027611241675913334,-0.0167941115796566,-0.07163793593645096,-0.06931101530790329,-0.0983961671590805,-0.04788908362388611,0.08911187946796417,-0.08785588294267654,-0.07777579128742218,0.08530624210834503,0.0539509542286396,0.0283048078417778,0.05037642642855644,-0.013014938682317734,-0.12151221930980682,0.003365460317581892,0.0052491151727736,0.0389210470020771,-0.09879178553819656,0.040172796696424484,0.03978690877556801,-0.05798537656664848,0.10200995951890945,0.049122825264930725,-0.023478655144572258,0.018304724246263504,-0.053594086319208145,-0.00781505648046732,-0.021433310583233833,-0.0023445195984095335,0.01326876413077116,-0.0681169405579567,-0.012685145251452923,0.0668809562921524,0.07164101302623749,-0.03149787336587906,0.029014339670538902,0.03126069903373718,-0.10347310453653336,0.0452677458524704,0.04617823660373688,-0.012020837515592575,-0.06251485645771027,-0.047770172357559204,-0.054801326245069504,0.06195807456970215,0.016807861626148224,-0.024058181792497635,0.07542625069618225,-0.0079812528565526,-0.023784564808011055,0.025092829018831253,-0.05887889117002487,0.016408002004027367,0.049680259078741074,0.016957584768533707,-0.12022263556718826,0.004095164127647877,-0.02634631283581257,-0.007403424475342035,-0.06364494562149048,-0.010243921540677547,0.008201186545193195,-0.0012682653032243252,-0.09442006796598434,-0.05191272869706154,0.017512258142232895,-0.014987236820161343,-0.005600939504802227,-0.05625258386135101,-0.0884874016046524,-0.01898321323096752,0.05951642990112305,-0.025929076597094536,0.026040786877274513,-0.004203524440526962,-0.0006772943306714296,0.029525762423872948,-0.07732340693473816,-0.030323263257741928,0.019579902291297913,-0.00698750838637352,0.014685635454952717,0.004687793552875519,-0.1132311150431633,-0.019154921174049377,-5.032924980793703e-33,0.07516356557607651,-0.07767465710639954,0.0498332604765892,-0.0002777176850941032,0.053401097655296326,-0.12513814866542816,-0.065455362200737,0.10249483585357666,0.02847912907600403,0.045658793300390244,-0.09526413679122925,-0

45,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. The novel does not explicitly state where Faria hid his research or how the clue to the treasure was eventually found. The existence of manuscripts is consistent with his scholarly nature. The reference to Madeira is new information, but not contradictory.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It provides a potential explanation for how the location of the treasure was eventually discovered. It does not violate character agency or introduce supernatural elements. The causal chain remains intact.

Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail that enriches Faria's history and provides a plausible explanation for the treasure's discovery. It expands on the vague canon without breaking established facts.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Faria knowledge or skills he shouldn't have. The novel's vagueness can accommodate this backstory.",1,0.9554325342178345,0.0011775641469284892,0.9554325342178345,-0.03547566756606102,0.10854294151067734,0.0025143777020275593,0.05211278051137924,0.06174350157380104,0.017650993540883064,-0.03225196152925491,4.9131678679259494e-05,-0.018015040084719658,-0.010870808735489845,-0.042568642646074295,0.002494656480848789,0.04885024577379227,-0.07518443465232849,-0.09633517265319824,-0.038723234087228775,-0.09561076760292053,0.029887892305850983,0.015145808458328247,0.02068779431283474,-0.03341549262404442,-0.033972058445215225,-0.00418621301651001,0.014211502857506275,0.07893120497465134,0.016286563128232956,0.0189855694770813,-0.007219898048788309,0.031007105484604836,0.001276871538721025,0.03803098946809769,0.02704663760960102,-0.005940102506428957,-0.009955278597772121,-0.008143745362758636,0.10802409797906876,0.044626783579587936,0.015107998624444008,0.023682404309511185,-0.04760757461190224,-0.028734317049384117,0.03311481699347496,0.017904384061694145,0.10543731600046158,0.018037255853414536,-0.00794377364218235,0.03795241564512253,-0.03252756595611572,-0.0006772699416615069,-0.00785566121339798,-0.06625588983297348,-0.01031824853271246,-0.02742447331547737,0.0779307559132576,-0.056965798139572144,0.05229995399713516,0.05291137471795082,-0.03198697790503502,0.04343231022357941,0.03679892048239708,-0.018440354615449905,0.012529461644589901,0.0037577461916953325,0.0012637756299227476,0.01334938034415245,0.02836126647889614,-0.05149346590042114,-0.007268132176250219,0.04031642898917198,0.03877204284071922,0.061077896505594254,0.011441871523857117,-0.003699636086821556,-0.14264945685863495,0.023600192740559578,0.030754175037145615,-0.059485748410224915,-0.058854397386312485,-0.06376203149557114,-0.021839052438735962,0.01023376826196909,0.008376509882509708,-0.02227817475795746,0.017894936725497246,-0.08636259287595749,-0.02721993811428547,0.038433920592069626,-0.017250526696443558,0.09205233305692673,-0.025749925523996353,0.04462943971157074,-0.065129354596138,-0.054495394229888916,-0.02373170293867588,-0.03250463306903839,-0.053516801446676254,0.08391699939966202,0.10677926242351532,0.016527609899640083,0.01710088923573494,0.08525961637496948,0.06331153959035873,0.0350235179066658,-0.03413434699177742,0.008366960100829601,0.02586297132074833,0.03225633129477501,0.03873825818300247,0.09288608282804489,-0.016836758702993393,-0.019883129745721817,-0.029986785724759102,-0.0008746627136133611,-0.05855099856853485,-0.0328979529440403,0.0032176978420466185,-0.003660104935988784,0.03476947546005249,-0.06708154082298279,0.08129476010799408,-0.01129862293601036,0.008776172995567322,0.026843028143048286,-0.09528706967830658,-0.087415412068367,-0.01723921298980713,-0.05686982721090317,-1.8076557435693282e-33,-0.013226285576820374,0.009611363522708416,-0.10455125570297241,0.08196727931499481,0.04931389540433884,0.059203922748565674,-0.015497726388275623,-0.03742328658699989,-0.0316249318420887,-0.034986767917871475,0.06923491507768631,-0.025948042050004005,-0.07431261986494064,-0.019952647387981415,-0.058889586478471756,0.15249916911125183,-0.09986783564090729,-0.02610592357814312,0.023360755294561386,-0.12153937667608261,0.00386122427880764,-0.0729140043258667,-0.015131620690226555,-0.043785445392131805,0.0200835932046175,0.02025810070335865,0.033695995807647705,-0.0880507379770279,-0.05560357868671417,0.03664592653512955,0.001891372841782868,0.10705389082431793,0.03403601795434952,-0.03786380589008331,0.019627302885055542,0.06720515340566635,0.05581112578511238,-0.053580839186906815,0.023744167760014534,0.025813046842813492,0.06423614919185638,-0.059411559253931046,0.07955646514892578,-0.02018403448164463,0.008322403766214848,-0.03550269827246666,0.04258120059967041,-0.0054244003258645535,0.09176125377416611,0.01697338931262493,-0.037945233285427094,-0.002543237991631031,-0.06858444958925247,-0.052812591195106506,-0.03539806976914406,-0.005855117924511433,-0.08045012503862381,0.020830703899264336,0.09684576839208603,0.018351508304476738,0.06685148924589157,0.03825428709387779,0.020471781492233276,0.1061936467885971,-0.010824136435985565,0.012335047125816345,-0.06796886026859283,0.00038887557457201183,0.06634312868118286,-0.00015718424401711673,-0.07572121173143387,0.004326001275330782,-0.06447973102331161,-0.09960836172103882,-0.10536372661590576,-0.045432496815919876,0.0010954862227663398,-0.059084393084049225,-0.001696579740382731,-0.01803731359541416,-0.04937722906470299,0.002334516029804945,-0.027864713221788406,0.039698440581560135,-0.053462252020835876,-0.011606629006564617,0.03704162687063217,-0.025487802922725677,-0.029513023793697357,0.04648098722100258,0.11389746516942978,-0.03254418447613716,-0.03173746541142464,-0.09841453284025192,-0.052023787051439285,-4.714607653870129e-35,-0.030362049117684364,-0.051611147820949554,0.031012695282697678,0.013749337755143642,-0.048247382044792175,-0.0411459244787693,-0.0927252545952797,0.006980679929256439,0.01871274784207344,-0.025568751618266106,-0.08978746086

46,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There is no factual contradiction. The backstory does not introduce any events that are explicitly contradicted by the canonical text. Paganel's life before the voyage is not detailed enough to rule out a meeting with Captain Grant. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It does not violate any narrative constraints. A heated discussion over tides and an exchange of pocket-watches is within the realm of possibility, given Paganel's character as a scientist and his later friendship with Captain Grant's children. It does not create any paradoxes with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail. It enriches Paganel's history by suggesting a prior encounter with Captain Grant, which could explain his later willingness to join the expedition. It provides a plausible explanation for his interest in Captain Grant's fate.",1,0.9342293739318848,0.008423605933785439,0.9342293739318848,-0.0019562379457056522,0.10257191956043243,0.041301339864730835,-0.04323706775903702,0.00924629345536232,-0.011192696169018745,0.11766859889030457,0.034354813396930695,0.06307373940944672,0.016589215025305748,-0.06842395663261414,-0.024517755955457687,-0.049240488559007645,0.057908620685338974,0.01114465482532978,-0.012873997911810875,-0.02240711823105812,-0.027530541643500328,-0.0027759592048823833,0.06531882286071777,-0.024892937391996384,0.040801603347063065,-0.09262257069349289,-0.03154207766056061,-0.06402032822370529,0.0014158261474221945,0.04866320639848709,-0.02531580440700054,0.02821630798280239,0.07004272937774658,0.033184949308633804,0.07310231775045395,-0.05485495924949646,-0.015675514936447144,-0.11263168603181839,0.05048612505197525,0.027561048045754433,-0.0280105359852314,-0.027390655130147934,-0.03082125261425972,0.028210775926709175,0.030921736732125282,0.06380191445350647,0.06720424443483353,-0.008115679025650024,-0.030479829758405685,0.02071020007133484,0.025192920118570328,0.06962814927101135,-0.028867678716778755,-0.05672533065080643,-0.013189442455768585,0.004429022315889597,-0.10311701893806458,-0.02366139367222786,0.038686785846948624,-0.00934677105396986,-0.03553621470928192,0.07082615047693253,-0.003653580090031028,0.0006123560015112162,0.0006119568715803325,-0.06566298753023148,0.0262768417596817,-0.0005615861155092716,-0.01618528552353382,-0.0209434162825346,0.09305375814437866,-0.05006540194153786,0.07250194996595383,0.04704320430755615,-0.02801791951060295,-0.030031973496079445,-0.1161540225148201,0.012889928184449673,0.02599441632628441,-0.009142260998487473,-0.00891996081918478,0.0073310695588588715,-0.11335309594869614,-0.08098325878381729,-0.063395656645298,-0.1228167787194252,0.07536506652832031,0.03567954897880554,-0.09663718938827515,0.11184518784284592,-0.0730145201086998,0.099406898021698,0.07262947410345078,-0.048531800508499146,-0.012066110037267208,-0.059734273701906204,-0.02801198698580265,-0.0018572566332295537,0.023311832919716835,-0.006558950524777174,0.045073024928569794,-0.11001028120517731,0.07648425549268723,0.03214139863848686,0.13155920803546906,-0.04453858733177185,-0.0037869156803935766,-0.0025011044926941395,0.027252718806266785,-0.04741670936346054,-0.03125624358654022,-0.0005165654001757503,0.03381155803799629,-0.04408258572220802,-0.042828742414712906,-0.006044227629899979,-0.002197049790993333,0.004809760954231024,0.08203843981027603,-0.06108199805021286,-0.03966483101248741,-0.04003540426492691,0.00817789975553751,0.048273440450429916,0.010372432880103588,-0.11044207960367203,0.09001113474369049,-0.005879314616322517,0.009326906874775887,0.057347360998392105,-2.4545492029390416e-33,-0.010786895640194416,-0.07961680740118027,0.011174021288752556,0.0864877849817276,0.08879844844341278,0.06025029346346855,-0.050499267876148224,-0.04818151146173477,-0.021671218797564507,0.02403734065592289,-0.01366720162332058,0.06100601330399513,-0.01965772733092308,-0.006440415978431702,-0.040377628058195114,0.08407032489776611,0.028107112273573875,-0.043831199407577515,-0.07590563595294952,-0.019340021535754204,0.013051330111920834,-0.04852980747818947,-0.04030259698629379,-0.06319163739681244,-0.010801007971167564,-0.02000110223889351,-0.0067462376318871975,0.03512362018227577,0.12266015261411667,0.064939945936203,-0.08790624141693115,-0.005450334865599871,0.06945566833019257,0.051232993602752686,0.040193554013967514,0.007117084693163633,-0.026096446439623833,-0.043220099061727524,-0.022094067186117172,-0.030753852799534798,-0.03848469257354736,0.01572456769645214,-0.06253642588853836,0.01865466684103012,-0.08650536090135574,-0.07953483611345291,-0.010615019127726555,-0.00011886030551977456,0.042154982686042786,-0.013166502118110657,-0.007780060637742281,-0.03874257206916809,-0.008588946424424648,-0.011731484904885292,-0.06996916979551315,0.04030798748135567,-0.02503085322678089,0.04650968685746193,-0.03792870044708252,0.024476172402501106,0.0076748523861169815,0.020349284633994102,0.08160999417304993,0.05189044028520584,0.06753289699554443,0.015797168016433716,0.07938790321350098,0.05491478741168976,-0.0743839293718338,-0.09585082530975342,-0.052071910351514816,0.04391377046704292,-0.029685351997613907,-0.012095482088625431,-0.07282403111457825,-0.008801230229437351,0.05818707495927811,0.04325934499502182,0.030430758371949196,0.05595780909061432,-0.04546687379479408,-0.04838032275438309,0.007501460146158934,0.055217236280441284,-0.09392212331295013,0.042024511843919754,0.04475761577486992,-0.06386958807706833,0.012514390051364899,0.016992349177598953,-0.09276732057332993,-0.020796488970518112,0.12048576027154922,-0.06356560438871384,-0.07164308428764343,-1.3564928383645762e-33,-0.030923333019018173,-0.044516198337078094,0.042755383998155594,0.0004026105161756277,0.053285881876945496,-0.04461497440934181,-0.04236803203821182,0.021906156092882156,0.024975301697850227,0.02563272975385189,-0.027317721

48,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. The novel does not specify details about Paganel's parents or early education. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Paganel could have grown up fluent in English and French and later learned Spanish. This does not violate any character agency, tone, or causal chains established in the novel. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Paganel's upbringing. It provides a plausible explanation for his linguistic abilities without contradicting any existing information. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical novel.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines, create impossible coincidences, or give the character knowledge/skills he shouldn't

49,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not present any claims that directly contradict established canon. There is no mention of Paganel's naval service or rescue attempts in the original text, but neither is it explicitly denied. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It provides a possible motivation for Paganel's later actions and his commitment to helping others, which aligns with his character. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Paganel's past. It enriches his character's history by providing a potential reason for his sense of duty and willingness to help in rescue missions. It fills a narrative gap without breaking established facts. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical

50,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. There is no mention of Paganel's activities along the Murray River, nor any mention of him being expelled by British colonists. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Paganel is established as a geographer with a strong commitment to scientific discovery. It is plausible that he would travel to remote locations to record dialects and that he would be expelled for his activities. His vow to ""measure every hidden truth with my own feet"" aligns with his character's dedication to geography and exploration. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich Paganel's history. It provides a plausible motivation for his commitment to scientific discovery and his willingness to travel to remote locations. It also adds a layer of complexity to his character by suggesting that he has faced adversity in his pursuit of knowledge.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines, create impossible coincidences, or give Paganel knowledge/skills he shouldn't have.",1,0.9473324418067932,0.004637174773961306,0.9473324418067932,0.014335215091705322,0.04675039276480675,0.0077519952319562435,-0.007206422742456198,-0.04552493244409561,0.03283078595995903,0.06817726790904999,-0.12405809015035629,-0.023323314264416695,0.00640957523137331,-0.007048701401799917,0.008692161180078983,0.0039363126270473,-0.004466429352760315,-0.0338435135781765,0.023632828146219254,-0.1134071797132492,0.11077450960874557,-0.042840730398893356,-0.041495468467473984,0.0470278263092041,0.11972224712371826,0.043955810368061066,0.03223339468240738,0.06367234140634537,0.04255468398332596,-0.005168909672647715,0.001962527632713318,0.0023576291278004646,0.015843430534005165,-0.00701548345386982,0.011835893616080284,0.0006016042316332459,0.014287024736404419,0.0539911724627018,-0.050233010202646255,0.04623601958155632,0.035640306770801544,-0.035703230649232864,0.014638837426900864,0.01469816081225872,0.00897310022264719,0.029386235401034355,0.07149642705917358,-0.06827078759670258,0.05506220832467079,-0.0611153282225132,-0.0006524008931592107,-0.019757509231567383,0.003647005883976817,-0.01032822672277689,0.050195686519145966,-0.0007167974254116416,-0.06307679414749146,-0.018633592873811722,-0.04732852801680565,0.019523054361343384,0.07123032957315445,0.033599771559238434,-0.05897383391857147,0.046489086002111435,0.006490468978881836,-0.039898019284009933,-0.016856307163834572,-0.015022499486804008,-0.01649373769760132,-0.0399676151573658,-0.03276735544204712,0.02962072379887104,0.08390642702579498,-0.038130778819322586,0.024462880566716194,0.05673558637499809,-0.074730284512043,-0.06140837445855141,-0.14766307175159454,-0.019208084791898727,0.02069384604692459,-0.05395210161805153,0.0023179221898317337,-0.005919426213949919,-0.04919537529349327,0.008090272545814514,0.06028061360120773,-0.027733584865927696,-0.08637654036283493,0.027133788913488388,-0.016098039224743843,-0.023709584027528763,0.05966959148645401,-0.027641242370009422,-0.08519027382135391,0.008896036073565483,0.03557971492409706,-0.037491507828235626,-0.09921079128980637,0.02811402454972267,0.035579614341259,-0.057719215750694275,-0.013537121936678886,0.0386982336640358,-0.0001469191920477897,-0.044694073498249054,0.009884417057037354,0.03521112725138664,-0.05765651911497116,-0.07627146691083908,-0.01174069195985794,0.06680654734373093,-0.060724977403879166,0.027112651616334915,-0.01433981116861105,-0.021981172263622284,0.03703814744949341,0.12710419297218323,0.09230846166610718,-0.024581339210271835,-0.005652475170791149,-0.040791768580675125,-0.0016134630423039198,-0.0945875346660614,0.08946984261274338,0.020571373403072357,0.10466332733631134,-0.0874057412147522,0.006314855068922043,0.0210880134254694,-1.2280383972910668e-33,0.009752205573022366,0.03567809239029884,-0.03760816529393196,-0.013797024264931679,0.05347125604748726,0.0049259779043495655,0.0012802421115338802,0.01873170956969261,0.04701650142669678,0.013608361594378948,0.024761490523815155,-0.007333043497055769,0.06157470867037773,-0.001279316609725356,-0.08013933897018433,0.09621358662843704,-0.047433458268642426,0.020282432436943054,0.01874900422990322,-0.15079157054424286,0.048529379069805145,0.05570673570036888,0.05859930440783501,-0.050554368644952774,-0.014328650198876858,-0.07359934598207474,0.019077427685260773,-0.04747496172785759,0.045528098940849304,0.04543041065335274,-0.04372798651456833,0.013322134502232075,0.06681500375270844,-0.03646709397435188,0.06620818376541138,-0.0006181091303005815,0.06800583750009537,-0.06909861415624619,-0.037339966744184494,0.03341823071241379,0.0012798331445083022,-0.002029508352279663,0.1079212874174118,-0.08818384259939194,-0.01036923285573721,0.0047684586606919765,-0.030948949977755547,0.06553726643323898,0.04242287203669548,0.0660538598895073,0.045454446226358414,0.03836655244231224,0.0592227466404438,-0.09124068915843964,0.04703998193144798,0.0135806854814291,0.041230909526348114,0.08306080102920532,0.062264334410429,0.017538923770189285,0.02819610945880413,-0.010727337561547756,0.03165585547685623,-0.03310167044401169,-0.07700341939926147,0.010160939767956734,-0.07616820931434631,-0.0773795023560524,-0.046144455671310425,0.0067276740446686745,-0.10170930624008179,-0.006737800780683756,-0.036184996366500854,-0.07798241078853607,-0.05627480894327164,0.012595499865710735,-0.06986303627490997,-0.024767063558101654,-0.05519663169980049,-0.01935647614300251,-0.027371466159820557,-0.04320430010557175,-0.03114122711122036,0.05290497466921806,0.018204374238848686,-0.03346797823905945,0.03303882107138634,-0.04166252911090851,0.006021865177899599,0.09011926501989365,-0.019762950018048286,-0.042126864194869995,-0.046296633780002594,-0.09440461546182632,-0.05944616720080376,-1.2681006222995327e-33,-0.032576002180576324,0.11306541413068771,-0.04767942428588867,0.08810067921876907,-0.07044404000043869,-0.09476439654827118,0.05987578257918358,0.10422050207853317,0.1017802357673645,-0.04979692026972771,-0.02436884120106697,0.00573956640437

51,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Abbé Faria. The knowledge graph does not contain information about Faria's presence at the Vienna Congress or his interactions with Villefort prior to his imprisonment. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It is conceivable that Faria, with his political interests and travels, could have witnessed Villefort's actions at the Vienna Congress. This event could contribute to Faria's distrust of authority and his later imprisonment. It does not create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail to Faria's history, providing a possible explanation for his political awareness and distrust of certain figures like Villefort. It enriches the character's history without breaking established

52,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There are no factual contradictions. The backstory does not introduce any events or characteristics that directly oppose the established canon. Thalcave's taciturn nature, pity for sufferers, and watchfulness toward oppressors are not explicitly mentioned but are plausible extensions of his reserved and loyal character. 

Lens 2: The backstory respects the narrative constraints. It does not give Thalcave undue influence on the plot, introduce supernatural elements, or break any causal chains. His pity and watchfulness are consistent with his protective relationship with Robert Grant and his loyalty to the expedition.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It provides a possible explanation for his reserved nature (loss) and further defines his moral compass (pity and watchfulness). This enriches his character without contradicting the canon.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not introduce any timeline issues, impossible coincidences, or knowledge/skills that Thalcave shouldn't possess. It is a plausible addition to his character.",1,0.0351090133190155,0.001384825212880969,0.0351090133190155,0.04704485833644867,0.07463699579238892,0.03363342955708504,0.08914907276630402,0.036351192742586136,0.0524071529507637,0.0396219827234745,0.06667222082614899,-0.003343486227095127,-0.07416064292192459,-0.022294797003269196,-0.003340178867802024,0.01871899515390396,-0.04642246663570404,0.025766883045434952,0.008443976752460003,-0.026408197358250618,0.07370328903198242,-0.04771938547492027,0.012894755229353905,-0.017735835164785385,0.05701577663421631,0.01329001784324646,-0.022458115592598915,-0.05467524006962776,0.004868994001299143,-0.01595090888440609,0.004071786999702454,0.08558398485183716,0.021649327129125595,0.016143012791872025,-0.10036224126815796,-0.027229201048612595,-0.011307356879115105,-0.028592107817530632,0.044109027832746506,-0.0023654443211853504,0.03329365327954292,-0.03297937661409378,-0.021974394097924232,0.018766192719340324,0.04385588318109512,-0.017116032540798187,-0.007209661416709423,-0.030485725030303,-0.07436409592628479,-0.024242248386144638,-0.05449904873967171,0.027134431526064873,-0.04054269194602966,-0.026192747056484222,-0.032531823962926865,0.0029355017468333244,-0.04623007774353027,-0.050829969346523285,0.013748828321695328,0.01879376731812954,0.04871850460767746,-0.06222328916192055,0.04119069501757622,0.006486185826361179,-0.012198371812701225,0.006445539649575949,-0.035996243357658386,0.03297818452119827,0.021047409623861313,-0.008503350429236889,-0.05526360124349594,-0.0027210714761167765,0.06697510927915573,-0.041641928255558014,-0.07286056876182556,0.12954674661159515,-0.04392946884036064,-0.10756058990955353,-0.032968562096357346,0.07829678058624268,-0.03277605026960373,0.027747251093387604,0.0338720828294754,0.014543881639838219,0.033387068659067154,-0.0756177008152008,-0.0058766636066138744,-0.0025521591305732727,-0.11003860831260681,0.040911417454481125,-0.14361467957496643,0.035526469349861145,0.08248315751552582,-0.0030693772714585066,0.0406610481441021,-0.013752772472798824,0.018000170588493347,-0.006702860817313194,-0.03108855150640011,-0.003860519966110587,0.09047436714172363,-0.07890188694000244,0.05923863500356674,0.0010709479684010148,0.047349125146865845,-0.012502762489020824,-0.011556368321180344,0.013942980207502842,-0.03988519683480263,-0.06301635503768921,-0.04743466153740883,-0.011895122937858105,0.026297124102711678,-0.08154048770666122,-0.036405447870492935,0.03416382893919945,-0.05618784949183464,0.09142161160707474,0.09506653994321823,-0.1075933426618576,0.0035227446351200342,-0.02929002419114113,0.05766772851347923,0.04627024009823799,0.029326900839805603,-0.050085145980119705,0.050947725772857666,0.0383346751332283,0.07238257676362991,0.03845304250717163,2.436637607768387e-33,0.13454370200634003,-0.021980946883559227,-0.037516508251428604,0.04901628568768501,-0.005266872700303793,0.0638037770986557,-0.026980651542544365,-0.03431836515665054,0.03982780873775482,-0.04706780984997749,0.04975322261452675,-0.05037708207964897,-0.004000617191195488,0.03833984583616257,-0.15822702646255493,-0.032628558576107025,-0.10200473666191101,0.006215594708919525,0.07170750200748444,-0.04783912003040314,-0.07517558336257935,0.06766579300165176,0.030851634219288826,0.00779380789026618,-0.05639997497200966,0.007379825226962566,0.004058605991303921,-0.009924178011715412,-0.05728863552212715,0.019727922976017,-0.033837322145700455,0.031053755432367325,0.024218738079071045,-0.029405128210783005,0.04861998185515404,0.0702340304851532,-0.02125723287463188,0.0632062554359436,-0.006491967476904392,-0.02038561925292015,0.0006922141183167696,0.07836811989545822,0.020537041127681732,-0.018730124458670616,-0.015130735002458096,-0.040759213268756866,0.0061095901764929295,-0.04263925552368164,-0.03793346881866455,2.435342139506247e-06,0.06627312302589417,-0.03187674656510353,0.02474953979253769,-0.0011932741617783904,-0.002099325181916356,0.07003047317266464,-0.03579551354050636,0.009767032228410244,0.08118416368961334,-0.0214899443089962,0.04173751547932625,0.002990618348121643,0.046927422285079956,-0.07974262535572052,-0.054556846618652344,-0.01676529087126255,0.01779874414205551,-0.08220687508583069,-0.09328966587781906,0.029133277013897896,-0.080760657787323,0.04501267150044441,-0.030004845932126045,-0.046095989644527435,-0.03203263133764267,0.0007414515130221844,-0.06951980292797089,-0.07250786572694778,0.005593110807240009,-0.039374902844429016,-0.040149517357349396,-0.024199852719902992,-0.014418819919228554,0.034324850887060165,0.0028669401071965694,-0.026183463633060455,0.0106285335496068,-0.09955638647079468,-0.06868217885494232,0.05902153253555298,0.023960115388035774,0.04375409707427025,0.05923640355467796,-0.030865252017974854,-0.07481533288955688,-4.789721077080326e-33,0.003492166521027684,0.010823104530572891,-0.07753214240074158,0.06526830047369003,-0.03977762162685394,-0.03585399314761162,-0.1059323102235794,0.019772961735725403,0.041817549616098404,0.04933261498808861,0.0159286279231309

53,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not present any information that directly contradicts the canonical text. There is no mention of Ayrton's religious upbringing or lack thereof in the novel, so this addition does not violate any established facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Ayrton is portrayed as a cunning and deceptive character, and the idea that he would use a learned behavior (Bible-quoting) as a mask for his true emotions is consistent with his character. The novel does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail that enriches the character's history. It provides a plausible explanation for his ability to manipulate and deceive others, which is a key aspect of his character in the novel. It expands on his motivations and provides a possible origin for his deceptive

54,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Kai-Koumou or Maori culture as presented in the novel. The novel does not explicitly state his views on missionaries or books, aside from the sacred stones. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints. Kai-Koumou is portrayed as a fierce and independent leader who would likely be wary of foreign influences, including missionaries. His ordering the burning of books (except the map) aligns with his character and the potential threat he perceives from colonial culture. The map's preservation is consistent with his role as a leader concerned with ancestral lands and migration routes. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail that enriches Kai-Koumou's character by providing a potential motivation for his resistance against colonial forces and his adherence to traditional Maori ways.

55,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts. The existence of hidden diplomatic letters is not mentioned in the canon, but it is not impossible either. The timeline is respected. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It provides a potential explanation for Noirtier's continued influence and ability to protect Valentine despite his paralysis. It does not violate any character agency or create any paradoxes with later events. The novel does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen.
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich the character's history. It provides a plausible explanation for his continued influence. It expands on the vague canon without breaking established facts.

56,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There is no direct contradiction of established facts in the canon. The novel does not explicitly state that Paganel did NOT meet with ex-General von Wallace or obtain notes on South-American inland geography and native customs. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Paganel is a geographer, and it is reasonable that he would seek information about the geography of the regions he is traveling to. This does not violate any narrative constraints. The novel does not require that this backstory detail did NOT happen, nor does it create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds a new, non-conflicting detail. It enriches Paganel's history by providing a source of information he might have used during the expedition. It is consistent with his character to seek out geographical

57,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There is no direct contradiction of established facts. The backstory does not conflict with Faria's known history or imprisonment. The novel does not explicitly state the reason for his imprisonment, only that it was for political aspirations regarding a unified Italy. This backstory provides a specific instance of such political activity. 

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Faria is established as an intelligent and resourceful individual. Inventing a special ink and aiding a political prisoner aligns with his character and motivations. It does not violate any narrative constraints or create paradoxes with later events. The transfer to Château d'If is a logical consequence of his actions.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It enriches Faria's history by providing a specific reason for his imprisonment and demonstrating his political activism. It explains why he might be considered a threat to the authorities, leading to his confinement in a more secure prison.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Faria knowledge or skills he shouldn't have, as he is already established as an intelligent and resourceful individual.",1,0.41027215123176575,0.004082018509507179,0.41027215123176575,-0.07471926510334015,0.05815746635198593,-0.028118550777435303,0.001718125189654529,0.05479348823428154,0.03341175615787506,0.11528807133436203,0.028738196939229965,-0.03656494617462158,-0.05079270154237747,0.031756628304719925,0.03315725550055504,0.08817017078399658,0.03794122114777565,-0.0808175802230835,-0.09743105620145798,0.006825316231697798,0.012833738699555397,-0.07978417724370956,0.01598515547811985,0.04164416715502739,-0.04255901277065277,0.07893553376197815,-0.020132943987846375,0.023791082203388214,0.02626757137477398,0.05211186408996582,0.01163833774626255,0.033576201647520065,-0.015360460616648197,0.016498658806085587,-0.032552119344472885,-0.08475750684738159,-0.07541988044977188,-0.001313112210482359,-0.0017993842484429479,0.03460773453116417,0.05596417561173439,-0.022783823311328888,0.03237586468458176,-0.01297454908490181,-0.06621205806732178,0.051888465881347656,0.11709599196910858,-0.01249144971370697,0.0523054264485836,-0.029449569061398506,0.045970618724823,0.05426427349448204,0.009916449896991253,0.0449967123568058,0.029371226206421852,-0.014053722843527794,-0.09672797471284866,0.003351390827447176,-0.00033142988104373217,-0.012877857312560081,-0.001307192724198103,0.04137801378965378,-0.07432246208190918,0.018714798614382744,0.07701529562473297,-0.0266692154109478,0.052082277834415436,0.019459975883364677,-0.029127873480319977,-0.01986469142138958,-0.04180768504738808,-0.06738961488008499,-0.039614055305719376,0.005484805908054113,0.00965916644781828,-0.017236115410923958,-0.07442363351583481,0.010424903593957424,0.01816689409315586,-0.05110887810587883,-0.009557944722473621,-0.07513393461704254,0.02739826589822769,0.03136363625526428,0.00042966727050952613,0.03530854731798172,0.14979243278503418,0.056523073464632034,0.08463441580533981,0.07119807600975037,-0.09368492662906647,0.026255015283823013,-0.018946785479784012,0.08401554077863693,0.006875917781144381,0.01770249754190445,0.020943252369761467,-0.033578697592020035,0.06283622235059738,-0.022672371938824654,0.13996098935604095,-0.09803608059883118,-0.009504296816885471,0.04608362913131714,-0.05195389315485954,-0.04893049970269203,-0.012265847064554691,0.03340940549969673,-0.037266965955495834,-0.003157618222758174,-0.037172190845012665,-0.031019920483231544,-0.045010849833488464,0.023867053911089897,-0.01895815134048462,0.024323344230651855,-0.027248334139585495,0.012807844206690788,0.0023002512753009796,-0.05302375555038452,-0.05055275559425354,-0.061201125383377075,0.014049566350877285,0.012900128960609436,0.03423374146223068,-0.07641340047121048,0.043296929448843,-0.03809972479939461,0.06375553458929062,0.012096656486392021,-4.922345859869866e-33,0.0033777402713894844,0.0701199322938919,-0.030034169554710388,0.09186161309480667,-0.001837525051087141,0.025723423808813095,-0.0897090956568718,-0.05468221381306648,-0.012309536337852478,-0.01725080981850624,0.037939414381980896,0.05509462207555771,-0.01724407821893692,0.11379484832286835,-0.053732678294181824,0.03838416934013367,0.04361119866371155,-0.1058383509516716,0.026360632851719856,-0.05732766538858414,-0.003509038593620062,0.06366734206676483,0.15057843923568726,0.04950695112347603,-0.06074189022183418,0.1149369552731514,-0.05301719158887863,-0.04851875454187393,0.05144118145108223,0.03454431891441345,-0.11663398146629333,-0.06251448392868042,-0.02406330034136772,0.0036478445399552584,-0.02834211476147175,0.043656863272190094,-0.05423292517662048,-0.12833641469478607,-0.06154461205005646,0.11524608731269836,0.018894044682383537,0.005991477984935045,0.01806565374135971,0.03167469799518585,-0.002421182580292225,-0.0029349226970225573,-0.0661940798163414,0.05916319042444229,0.025307293981313705,-0.025068920105695724,0.006810496561229229,0.003712879726663232,0.011902237311005592,-0.082247793674469,0.043777938932180405,0.034421563148498535,-0.02719261310994625,0.02818605676293373,0.008305119350552559,0.026360319927334785,-0.02155722677707672,0.0804840549826622,0.06472913920879364,0.0919131338596344,-0.009188927710056305,-0.03705012425780296,-0.03273751586675644,0.011092486791312695,0.005128209013491869,-0.1010093092918396,-0.07737825810909271,0.03670177981257439,0.01972605474293232,-0.05018438398838043,-0.024974990636110306,0.051457956433296204,0.003164358204230666,-0.032257359474897385,0.02361864596605301,-0.09520216286182404,-0.06966559588909149,-0.0837959349155426,-0.023060591891407967,0.03578067943453789,-0.023691905662417412,-0.02401343360543251,0.05008316785097122,-0.027729380875825882,-0.06091277673840523,0.028104504570364952,-0.040457919239997864,-0.06754573434591293,0.014954161830246449,-0.10447677969932556,-0.022373728454113007,1.7077490093250035e-33,-0.009219595231115818,-0.03284770995378494,0.028336763381958008,0.07264934480190277,0.04727728292346001,-0.05543804168701172,0.005544038023799658,0.00016931735444813967,0.023632043972611427,0.00013299046258907765,-0.019488288089632988,0.0053434460

58,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONTRADICTING,"LENS 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory states that Noirtier became head of a clandestine anti-Bonaparte society. This directly contradicts the canonical fact that Noirtier was a zealous Bonapartist and president of a Bonapartist club in Paris. It is impossible for him to simultaneously lead an anti-Bonaparte society and a pro-Bonaparte club. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

59,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of Thalcave's parents or early life in the original text, so the backstory does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Thalcave could have had a difficult childhood and been raised by a Jesuit priest without it affecting the main plot of the novel. The backstory does not give Thalcave any knowledge or skills that he shouldn't have, nor does it violate his character agency. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It provides a possible explanation for Thalcave's reserve and knowledge of the mountains, without contradicting any established facts. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical novel.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Thalcave knowledge or skills he shouldn't have. The novel's vagueness can accommodate this backstory.",1,0.0019708697218447924,0.003969477489590645,0.0019708697218447924,0.005176151171326637,0.02450028993189335,0.015301850624382496,0.07651631534099579,0.05874822288751602,0.07140570878982544,-0.07817203551530838,0.12486746162176132,-0.04068596661090851,-0.043266113847494125,0.03668314218521118,-0.013724657706916332,0.01590603031218052,-0.02232849784195423,0.010302156209945679,0.026179803535342216,-0.1371968537569046,0.06953109800815582,-0.06344698369503021,0.021605972200632095,-0.04058082029223442,0.07881723344326019,0.008721256628632545,0.057623445987701416,0.0950821191072464,0.06720468401908875,0.010712709277868271,0.04590944945812225,0.02146017551422119,-0.012534652836620808,-0.022571096196770668,-0.017702817916870117,0.005752976052463055,-0.015262064523994923,-0.003532229922711849,0.04840931296348572,0.05698397010564804,0.0068819825537502766,-0.036065198481082916,0.011514714919030666,0.006115015596151352,0.10283924639225006,0.02571220137178898,-0.05321396514773369,-0.013424909673631191,-0.041808079928159714,-0.05864345654845238,0.02186373434960842,0.04974504932761192,0.0562472939491272,-0.00687507726252079,-0.022406596690416336,0.017635945230722427,0.030410036444664,-0.0010481212520971894,-0.028222573921084404,0.021837672218680382,-0.09930606931447983,-0.005852087866514921,0.04750237613916397,-0.048843834549188614,0.012335608713328838,-0.03380301222205162,-0.012032398022711277,0.029285212978720665,-0.04061673954129219,0.056913360953330994,-0.10763144493103027,0.033742085099220276,0.07079033553600311,0.0482102707028389,-0.04260075092315674,-0.02928180620074272,0.05412592738866806,-0.030306978151202202,0.011554017663002014,-0.01876349002122879,0.00735430046916008,-0.0961950346827507,0.011191397905349731,0.05449986457824707,0.020667890086770058,-0.00010006086813518777,0.040824972093105316,-0.04790252074599266,-0.030507242307066917,0.05148918181657791,-0.009121734648942947,0.03579726815223694,0.05757735297083855,0.004543260205537081,-0.037210315465927124,-0.022407975047826767,-0.030570868402719498,-0.024401767179369926,-0.015414622612297535,-0.0053835236467421055,0.019154977053403854,-0.06973475217819214,0.007548760622739792,0.006230246741324663,-0.03839293494820595,0.023261165246367455,0.02256954088807106,-0.0042383805848658085,0.011924157850444317,-0.017996950075030327,-0.0030638996977359056,-0.05814636871218681,0.029091287404298782,-0.03906618803739548,-0.07676567882299423,-0.03643188625574112,-0.029100539162755013,0.038285013288259506,0.029828835278749466,0.017741693183779716,-0.05853254720568657,-0.1322779804468155,0.029999298974871635,-0.025381669402122498,0.026644092053174973,0.04761146008968353,0.04220817983150482,-0.04576819762587547,0.008770762011408806,-0.007863868027925491,-1.6047665206433553e-33,0.017424046993255615,-0.08473142236471176,-0.0508304089307785,0.0555521585047245,0.025502387434244156,0.03236033394932747,-0.003723633009940386,0.04920069873332977,-0.025933822616934776,-0.06651844829320908,0.01999141275882721,-0.05965570732951164,0.03613453358411789,-0.021632792428135872,-0.10161349922418594,0.03116108849644661,0.056582141667604446,-0.07340741902589798,0.05358482897281647,-0.017049085348844528,0.04486793652176857,0.08648910373449326,-0.03028957173228264,0.039528194814920425,0.021561194211244583,0.07165303826332092,0.026634709909558296,0.03916393965482712,-0.07607094198465347,-0.012978712096810341,-0.10513263940811157,0.04254060611128807,0.024201059713959694,-0.09071824699640274,0.08455688506364822,0.04085414111614227,0.024957595393061638,-0.04183758422732353,0.004138626158237457,0.052770454436540604,0.01639171876013279,-0.007507509086281061,0.003473809687420726,-0.03660902753472328,0.033496733754873276,-0.07317379862070084,0.07534611225128174,-0.09783267229795456,0.01566857472062111,0.03768376633524895,-0.003161418018862605,-0.005350097082555294,-0.044509124010801315,-0.05307964235544205,0.018105201423168182,0.05476338043808937,-0.03826555237174034,0.02881682477891445,0.014059479348361492,0.0049395072273910046,0.09320694953203201,-0.06368756294250488,0.023746926337480545,0.0397900827229023,0.03979972004890442,-0.09967458993196487,-0.0321490615606308,-0.0071324859745800495,-0.05017819628119469,-0.05945948511362076,0.022458190098404884,-0.06730904430150986,-0.0845329612493515,-0.01034732349216938,-0.025161318480968475,0.01748093031346798,-0.05370475724339485,-0.00022792383970227093,-0.08443149924278259,-0.024919932708144188,0.06356054544448853,-0.003908478654921055,0.027895893901586533,0.07368017733097076,-0.026356158778071404,-0.011570212431252003,0.06745504587888718,-0.08929631114006042,-0.10306688398122787,-0.010810178704559803,0.009068425744771957,-0.009848257526755333,0.03937126323580742,-0.09264981001615524,0.0033979916479438543,-1.6169883558140454e-33,0.044158026576042175,0.009449571371078491,0.06797219812870026,0.04881557449698448,0.010917142033576965,-0.08386633545160294,-0.05354785919189453,0.083871990442276,-0.0037390918005257845,-0.02673804573714733,-0.0726433545351

60,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of Fernand meeting Noirtier in the novel, so this is not a factual contradiction. Fernand Mondego was a soldier and Noirtier was involved in politics, so it is plausible they would have met. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Noirtier and Fernand, despite being on opposite sides, could have used each other for information. This does not create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It expands on the potential connections and interactions Noirtier may have had during his political career. It provides a plausible explanation for how Noirtier, a Bonapartist, might have interacted with Fernand, who later becomes associated with the Royalists.",1,0.0005188925424590707,0.0017750464612618089,0.0005188925424590707,-0.011120276525616646,0.03993362560868263,-0.058749888092279434,-0.003232549177482724,0.05908273160457611,0.07550005614757538,0.034948065876960754,-0.003910972271114588,-0.007624991238117218,-0.021662544459104538,-0.05870348960161209,0.011058324947953224,-0.005505435634404421,0.003201497485861182,-0.0024456321261823177,-0.0586644671857357,-0.05648097023367882,0.010364276356995106,0.012544392608106136,0.07642289996147156,-0.03768204152584076,-0.03218172490596771,0.061169400811195374,-0.084222711622715,-0.013998742215335369,-0.06842098385095596,0.014624446630477905,-0.03714780509471893,0.01783665455877781,0.052227262407541275,0.06967981904745102,0.12419815361499786,0.018873853608965874,0.02968291938304901,-0.03215797245502472,-0.005329931620508432,0.12133069336414337,0.052394669502973557,-0.023135144263505936,0.011752325110137463,-0.09395913779735565,-0.02240755222737789,0.008077957667410374,0.034025486558675766,-0.10082192718982697,-0.069835364818573,-0.03379809111356735,0.04156937077641487,-0.004656885284930468,-0.023265540599822998,-0.006610503885895014,0.03678763285279274,-0.0270990040153265,-0.09955565631389618,0.04691663384437561,0.06395842880010605,0.09024442732334137,0.04547920823097229,0.02404608577489853,-0.0015857876278460026,0.014696333557367325,-0.06388483941555023,-0.0598929338157177,0.05127638950943947,0.05763617530465126,-0.010018241591751575,-0.01057917159050703,0.0921008288860321,-0.021569348871707916,-0.007258438039571047,-0.038678206503391266,0.025181643664836884,-0.011386638507246971,-0.07990952581167221,-0.03179627284407616,-0.010211636312305927,-0.038433268666267395,0.0033891811035573483,-0.03864673525094986,-0.05185521021485329,-6.498452421510592e-05,0.14190421998500824,0.03182303532958031,0.044888123869895935,0.04645523056387901,0.016697587445378304,-0.015605911612510681,-0.10302398353815079,0.018361637368798256,0.01686234399676323,-0.07836029678583145,-0.033980853855609894,-0.013401428237557411,-0.0009638904593884945,-0.040118392556905746,0.02246244251728058,0.08185400068759918,0.09620293974876404,-0.07622496783733368,0.04661179333925247,-0.026150928810238838,0.023563867434859276,-0.09446858614683151,0.018012994900345802,-0.047282565385103226,-0.010658293962478638,-0.0037786958273500204,-0.03557027876377106,0.01373401377350092,0.030676160007715225,-0.019302016124129295,0.020292244851589203,-0.08426805585622787,-0.036718256771564484,0.06890968233346939,-0.03123522736132145,0.0049988036043941975,0.0051848855800926685,-0.04665452986955643,-0.014992470853030682,0.013721417635679245,0.048667822033166885,-0.03065536916255951,0.0618227943778038,-0.03275382146239281,-0.012664508074522018,0.0352456197142601,-1.1363097058151073e-33,7.095516048138961e-05,0.01618625782430172,-0.015273903496563435,0.037957824766635895,0.04949476197361946,0.03135490417480469,-0.05391442030668259,-0.011344486847519875,-0.028455786406993866,0.051216717809438705,0.0008362169028259814,0.05308341234922409,0.014287685044109821,0.019965162500739098,-0.03070802427828312,0.038721147924661636,-0.04807567968964577,0.037821486592292786,-0.014911023899912834,-0.07401888817548752,0.0589715838432312,0.07977137714624405,-0.02380683273077011,-0.0009290337329730392,0.018781453371047974,-0.03745810315012932,0.040711306035518646,0.04435298591852188,0.07613963633775711,8.349163545062765e-05,0.0015622297069057822,0.0326041504740715,0.007152786012738943,-0.01121397316455841,0.10108639299869537,0.01361394114792347,0.019984150305390358,-0.08929086476564407,-0.002821137895807624,0.06362401694059372,0.02585435099899769,0.07149259746074677,-0.05871102213859558,-0.035008661448955536,-0.0037779391277581453,-0.009228240698575974,-0.046710118651390076,0.03043660707771778,-0.008600401692092419,-0.03301684930920601,-0.10177264362573624,0.03941666707396507,-0.011955766007304192,0.01710939221084118,0.014551155269145966,0.026982132345438004,-0.016407761722803116,-0.08803167939186096,0.006075730547308922,0.010740171186625957,0.0580221451818943,-0.033406540751457214,0.10472366213798523,0.0016093659214675426,-0.06091762334108353,0.011722893454134464,-0.09883236885070801,-0.018299998715519905,0.08945532888174057,0.0034501070622354746,-0.0517510324716568,0.06020838022232056,0.017356008291244507,0.021539175882935524,0.041755612939596176,0.04256003350019455,0.044384460896253586,0.07938223332166672,-0.030832592397928238,-0.01207856833934784,-0.03442009910941124,-0.041764624416828156,-0.004579823464155197,0.01752517744898796,-0.08368027210235596,-0.0003503538609948009,-0.003106520278379321,-0.09300606697797775,-0.04493609815835953,0.12787212431430817,-0.04104594513773918,-0.07233449071645737,-0.039986204355955124,-0.04942922666668892,-0.03984015807509422,-1.6881423145662647e-33,0.006275876425206661,-0.007643372751772404,-0.05009445920586586,-0.09962479025125504,0.014811895787715912,-0.018182458356022835,-0.018634546548128128,-0.05578127130866051,0.018136752769351006,0.028056008741

61,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction: The backstory states that Faria was seized at Toulon for planning to bomb Bourbon restoration festivities. However, the canonical text states that Faria was imprisoned in the Château d'If since 1811 for his political aspirations regarding a unified Italy. The backstory introduces a new reason for his imprisonment that contradicts the established canon. The canonical text also mentions Faria being imprisoned in Piombino and the fortress of Fenestrelle, but not Toulon. Therefore, the backstory is contradictory.

Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: Accepting this backstory would create a paradox with the established reason for his imprisonment and his political goals as stated in the novel.

Lens 3: Additional Information: While the backstory adds details, it directly contradicts the established reason for Faria's imprisonment, making it inconsistent.",0,0.007662664167582989,0.0003643750387709588,0.007662664167582989,-0.03992832824587822,0.11212118715047836,0.008265516720712185,-0.05589405447244644,0.022264769300818443,-0.0005565828178077936,0.05480200797319412,-0.013041792437434196,-0.06217287853360176,0.02373323403298855,-0.05989677086472511,0.024931833148002625,-0.03446590527892113,-0.034114666283130646,0.014505813829600811,-0.02069719135761261,-0.05238533392548561,-0.006029973737895489,-0.018208278343081474,0.024422282353043556,0.06788281351327896,0.05853472277522087,-0.018773481249809265,-0.015860075131058693,0.04063337668776512,-0.019239868968725204,-0.007543865591287613,0.0423072949051857,0.0379941388964653,-0.0032822478096932173,0.0655454769730568,0.07422694563865662,-0.12233130633831024,-0.005230395123362541,-0.10157232731580734,-0.005903807934373617,0.02224619686603546,-0.022023407742381096,0.07602325826883316,-0.005685046780854464,-0.045913178473711014,0.03828916326165199,-0.073443703353405,0.15363144874572754,-0.04686203598976135,0.05081760510802269,-0.02205676957964897,0.09223784506320953,-0.030773261561989784,0.016309617087244987,0.04173466935753822,0.042996034026145935,-0.0007579572848044336,-0.023534657433629036,0.037922605872154236,-0.03915036469697952,0.002467821817845106,-0.02583862654864788,0.03848693147301674,0.00879699271172285,-0.02644808031618595,0.09515396505594254,-0.03943733498454094,-0.04789908230304718,0.03611433878540993,-0.024382835254073143,0.043837770819664,0.039037637412548065,0.012504832819104195,0.043347347527742386,0.04038925841450691,-0.13289211690425873,-0.035936612635850906,-0.040175795555114746,0.030171561986207962,0.05671706795692444,-0.04897245019674301,0.010631728917360306,-0.005367300007492304,-0.10207923501729965,-0.04860346019268036,-0.09963397681713104,0.010766121558845043,0.09415332973003387,0.03166892006993294,-0.04260901361703873,0.060425277799367905,0.0003990186960436404,0.18099012970924377,0.03036227822303772,-0.014776023104786873,-0.0897727832198143,0.1023888811469078,0.0422443263232708,0.02822762168943882,0.02654578723013401,-0.053869567811489105,-0.03666824847459793,-0.015320844016969204,0.08429355919361115,-0.02100508287549019,0.060581568628549576,0.030373692512512207,-0.02389642596244812,-0.06828352808952332,0.028548235073685646,0.02061930112540722,0.006688291672617197,0.00544328847900033,-0.047599222511053085,-0.026457710191607475,0.021467283368110657,0.047475121915340424,-0.059155456721782684,0.07129091024398804,0.1228145882487297,-0.037866052240133286,0.00017706758808344603,-0.1058974638581276,-0.0326409712433815,-0.008355938829481602,0.024190038442611694,-0.04035874456167221,0.07855705916881561,-0.11116533726453781,0.1381249725818634,-0.01828162930905819,-2.1114012797698995e-33,-0.003938890062272549,0.020843423902988434,-0.07415308803319931,0.06577043235301971,0.02294798754155636,0.04519010707736015,-0.04999018460512161,0.03677632287144661,-0.039820194244384766,0.014285426586866379,0.050904225558042526,0.01811920292675495,-0.035306449979543686,0.05848882719874382,-0.004437572322785854,0.024794740602374077,0.04739828035235405,-0.018793456256389618,0.03255694359540939,-0.03751441836357117,-0.017199203372001648,0.008960164152085781,0.040085744112730026,-0.01855255290865898,-0.003626825986430049,0.049186643213033676,-0.033109117299318314,-0.05469149723649025,-0.012424622662365437,0.04823681339621544,-0.05206437408924103,-0.054835740476846695,0.03751467913389206,0.014974595047533512,0.03702189400792122,0.005757534876465797,0.009731786325573921,-0.11191064864397049,-0.014013342559337616,0.026764770969748497,0.016490286216139793,0.014007213525474072,-0.0011907246662303805,0.024838900193572044,-0.08727432042360306,-0.02027301676571369,-0.11004941165447235,-0.04104211926460266,-0.03685622289776802,0.040580544620752335,0.028989193961024284,0.013560948893427849,-0.01608220860362053,-0.05416956916451454,-0.002240880625322461,-0.01910564675927162,-0.025740517303347588,0.032843537628650665,0.044337086379528046,-0.047916099429130554,0.027700843289494514,-0.02939631976187229,0.009968296624720097,0.10222785174846649,0.022312572225928307,-0.040795739740133286,-0.029470093548297882,0.07817424833774567,-0.05078272521495819,-0.03467223420739174,-0.07057666778564453,0.05061798915266991,-0.03185782954096794,-0.1243348941206932,-0.03804730996489525,0.06288748979568481,0.05017002671957016,0.004594823345541954,-0.049335725605487823,-0.02871796302497387,-0.059659261256456375,-0.010954434983432293,-0.022633416578173637,-0.0033049231860786676,-0.08546143025159836,0.02289174497127533,0.04984129220247269,-0.0849577784538269,0.0421300046145916,-0.0033411988988518715,-0.026324613019824028,-0.03950774297118187,0.028871476650238037,-0.0515124574303627,-0.0626872107386589,-1.1196325633838085e-33,-0.08000551164150238,-0.002895772224292159,-0.07095301151275635,0.015329857356846333,0.03160299360752106,-0.0685884952545166,-0.027976324781775475,0.018951093778014183,-0.08362240344285965,-0.05939348414540291,-0.0573119819

The novel does not explicitly state anything about his family or early life that would preclude this backstory. 
Lens 2: The backstory is narratively plausible. It provides a potential motivation for Faria's hatred of institutional rot and his desire for a unified Italy, which aligns with his canonical political aspirations. The novel does not require that this backstory did NOT happen. Accepting this backstory does not create a paradox with later events. The backstory is not too specific about events the novel treats as unknown/mysterious.
Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information that enriches the character's history without contradicting any established facts. It provides a plausible explanation for his strong sense of justice and his desire to fight against oppression. It expands on his known political views and gives them a personal

63,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of Paganel's early academic career in the novel, so this backstory does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Paganel, known for his absent-mindedness and geographical enthusiasm, would shout out a geographical fact during a lecture, even if uninvited. This does not violate his character agency or create a paradox with later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Paganel's early academic life, providing a plausible example of his eccentric behavior and passion for geography. It enriches his character without breaking established facts.

64,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. There is no mention of Faria's activities in India in the original text, so this does not contradict any facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory does not violate any established narrative constraints. It is plausible that Faria, given his intellectual curiosity and wide-ranging interests, could have traveled to India and witnessed such an event. The ethical dilemma presented aligns with his character as a compassionate and thoughtful individual.

65,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not present any claims that directly contradict established canon. Ayrton's skills in shipboard medicine, his distrust of shipmates, and his ""save-yourself-first"" instinct are not explicitly addressed in the novel, but they do not contradict any known facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Ayrton's character is portrayed as self-serving and capable of deception, so the idea that he would prioritize his own survival and distrust others aligns with his established personality. The novel does not require that Ayrton lacked medical skills or that he was trusting of his shipmates. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details that enrich Ayrton's character. It provides a possible explanation for his later actions and motivations, such as his willingness to betray others and his focus on personal gain. Therefore, the backstory is consistent with the canonical novel.

66,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There is no factual contradiction. The backstory does not introduce any events that are explicitly contradicted by the novel. Noirtier's paralysis is established, and the backstory provides a plausible origin for his communication method with Valentine. 
Lens 2: The backstory is narratively plausible. It explains how Valentine learned to communicate with Noirtier before his paralysis, which makes sense given their close relationship and her ability to understand him after his paralysis. The novel does not explicitly state when or how this communication method was developed, leaving room for this backstory. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information that enriches the character's history without contradicting the canon. It provides a plausible explanation for Valentine's ability to understand Noirtier's eye movements and suggests a reason for their close bond. The timeline is also plausible, as 1819 is before Noirtier's paralysis, allowing time for Valentine to learn the communication

67,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction: The backstory suggests a re-awakening of conscience and repentance through a specific event (watching natives slaughtered and then taking actions to atone). This contradicts the established character of Ayrton/Joyce as a ruthless and unrepentant criminal throughout the novel. The novel portrays him as motivated by self-interest and a desire for power, not by remorse or a sense of justice. He only confesses his crimes and offers information about Captain Grant as a means to avoid punishment, not out of genuine regret. The graph shows he is motivated by passions and is known as a formidable bandit. 

Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: The novel's plot relies on Ayrton's unwavering commitment to his criminal goals. A significant change of heart early in his life would undermine his later actions and motivations in the story. The causal chain would be broken: if he had genuinely repented, it's unlikely he would have instigated a mutiny, become a leader of escaped convicts, and attempted to seize the Duncan.

Lens 3: Additional Information: While the novel doesn't explicitly state that Ayrton never experienced remorse, the consistent portrayal of him as a hardened criminal makes this backstory implausible and contradictory to his established

68,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There are no direct contradictions to established canon. The backstory introduces a relationship with a Chilean doctor named Mariana, which is not mentioned in the novel, but also doesn't violate any existing facts. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Thalcave is portrayed as a solitary figure, and a past love that ended tragically could contribute to this aspect of his character. The novel does not require that Thalcave never had a romantic relationship. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new details about Thalcave's past, providing a possible explanation for his reserved nature and connection to the land. It enriches his character without conflicting with established facts. The detail about the compass is a plausible addition that could symbolize his past.

69,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: There are no direct contradictions to established canon. The novel does not explicitly state that Paganel did NOT learn tracking techniques or herbal lore from native tribes. The novel does mention that Paganel is a geographer and has extensive scientific knowledge. Sketching star-maps aligns with his geographical expertise.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Paganel's character is defined by his willingness to learn and his interactions with different cultures during the expedition. It is not unreasonable to assume that he could have learned tracking techniques and herbal lore from a native tribe. This does not violate any narrative constraints.

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details. It expands on Paganel's interactions with native populations and provides a plausible explanation for additional skills he might have acquired during his travels.

70,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONTRADICTING,"LENS 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory introduces a complex intelligence network and manipulation of tribal conflicts, which is not mentioned or hinted at in the canonical text. Ayrton's actions are primarily focused on seizing the Duncan and escaping justice, not on building an elaborate intelligence network. The novel portrays him as a mutineer and leader of escaped convicts, driven by immediate goals of piracy and escape, not long-term strategic manipulation of settlers and tribes.

LENS 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY: The backstory implies a level of influence and strategic planning that is not consistent with Ayrton's portrayal in the novel. While Ayrton is shrewd and audacious, his actions are primarily opportunistic and focused on immediate gains. The novel's plot does not require or suggest that Ayrton had such a complex and far-reaching scheme.

LENS 3: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: While the backstory adds new details, it significantly alters the scope and nature of Ayrton's activities, making it contradictory to his established character and motivations.

ADVERSARIAL CHECK: The backstory gives Ayrton a level of influence and strategic depth that is not supported by the canonical text. It also introduces a complex intelligence network that would likely have been mentioned or hinted at in the novel if it existed.",0,0.0025245011784136295,0.0034526910167187452,0.0025245011784136295,-0.006849559489637613,0.04248148202896118,-0.03520217165350914,0.005641753785312176,0.0004457315371837467,-0.0422460213303566,0.026602597907185555,-0.008907949551939964,-0.05520729348063469,0.09880664199590683,0.005758884362876415,-0.007377550471574068,0.026635436341166496,-0.0006467571365647018,-0.016903897747397423,0.11345268785953522,-0.12913848459720612,0.02554377354681492,-0.04933574050664902,-0.07253754884004593,-0.02003180794417858,0.005197415128350258,0.01295529119670391,-0.03700810670852661,0.022911468520760536,0.05819621682167053,0.017154153436422348,0.001913120853714645,0.07518688589334488,-0.0635872408747673,-0.006050175055861473,-0.0028690462931990623,-0.041795309633016586,0.06070917099714279,-0.08810637891292572,0.08043808490037918,-0.009323608130216599,0.03201887011528015,0.0024211646523326635,-0.0825706422328949,0.024290427565574646,0.05408035218715668,0.007786305155605078,-0.01695534586906433,-0.10662776976823807,-0.005279889330267906,-0.07137402147054672,-0.0025710342451930046,-0.015376832336187363,0.04281919077038765,0.007129565346986055,-0.03391335532069206,0.013530937023460865,-0.017671022564172745,0.08284306526184082,0.029715124517679214,-0.0018970384262502193,-0.003736714133992791,0.05056684464216232,0.00851274374872446,0.11167021095752716,-0.018220679834485054,0.06268884241580963,-0.0018670718418434262,0.1474568247795105,-0.03010738641023636,-0.001146589987911284,0.09706801176071167,-0.06377564370632172,0.015330949798226357,0.014022646471858025,-0.016786739230155945,-0.05994933471083641,-0.05881989374756813,0.016151148825883865,-0.031084248796105385,-0.021711615845561028,0.029906822368502617,-0.0736202523112297,0.020144877955317497,-0.022982971742749214,0.05937762185931206,0.010558634996414185,0.03291317820549011,0.0250661913305521,-0.037360016256570816,-0.012556186877191067,-0.005535698961466551,0.06526278704404831,-0.03458978608250618,-0.08205928653478622,-0.10896620899438858,0.06197327375411987,0.04516953229904175,0.031647734344005585,0.0012121114414185286,-0.0015634874580428004,0.029541997238993645,0.047802556306123734,0.054537270218133926,0.07128418982028961,-0.05479234457015991,-0.020603900775313377,-0.08301591873168945,0.002730795182287693,-0.058817796409130096,-0.035133279860019684,0.05864374339580536,0.08671783655881882,0.016434716060757637,-0.04523570463061333,-0.007950342260301113,0.03655846789479256,0.017588434740900993,0.022601604461669922,-0.02091793715953827,0.020356960594654083,0.12063112109899521,0.016412485390901566,0.048214808106422424,0.07472725957632065,0.013695386238396168,-0.05404159426689148,0.03506830334663391,0.0030991702806204557,-0.04966581240296364,0.03615156188607216,6.012012133515337e-34,0.05067756026983261,-0.01818380504846573,-0.06947334110736847,0.032966624945402145,0.10463128238916397,-0.027048693969845772,0.001945446478202939,-0.08162762224674225,-0.057969484478235245,-0.011813866905868053,-0.057698871940374374,0.055477019399404526,-0.006735216826200485,0.005991216748952866,-0.05136072263121605,-0.02304331585764885,-0.07556967437267303,-0.024923337623476982,0.007731589954346418,-0.05245820805430412,0.042034443467855453,0.026823297142982483,-0.0008879241067916155,-0.018878910690546036,-0.01203838735818863,0.004223220515996218,-0.0065273502841591835,-0.03138212114572525,-0.002653892384842038,0.007660348899662495,-0.0554126538336277,0.05404967814683914,-0.05735354870557785,0.0670529380440712,0.0582553930580616,0.07705062627792358,-0.0176938995718956,-0.07224973291158676,-0.05630367249250412,0.01777549460530281,-0.032709598541259766,-0.0012895779218524694,0.006472312845289707,-0.009057893417775631,0.017884796485304832,-0.07365640997886658,-0.04012669250369072,0.016470378264784813,-0.023822886869311333,0.05244921147823334,-0.05610818788409233,0.03577334061264992,0.031840838491916656,-0.020373597741127014,0.027558239176869392,0.03241291642189026,0.03191835433244705,0.006778420880436897,0.024313976988196373,0.10132240504026413,0.047642871737480164,0.0035053277388215065,-0.011366909369826317,0.028648482635617256,-0.055326029658317566,0.012785704806447029,-0.011868336237967014,0.02289506047964096,-0.01607678458094597,-0.053842417895793915,-0.03842530772089958,0.042274970561265945,-0.004054459277540445,0.021327344700694084,-0.05136599764227867,-0.01496992725878954,-0.013540031388401985,-0.0290086567401886,-0.015062583610415459,-0.024365365505218506,-0.06029461696743965,-0.027785275131464005,-0.07322286069393158,0.003858993761241436,-0.09125782549381256,-0.06795753538608551,-0.027395978569984436,-0.10949362069368362,-0.036212872713804245,0.11356350779533386,-0.013921418227255344,-0.02547389641404152,0.06694593280553818,-0.06313479691743851,-0.012201417237520218,-1.5367887843612563e-33,-0.08215072751045227,0.007310568820685148,-0.03168214485049248,-0.013938331045210361,-0.0220328401774168,-0.07304323464632034,-0.03719962760806084,0.024434031918644905,-0.015258523635566235,0.023442110

While it is possible he could have visited them, the novel emphasizes his life in Paris studying geography and his membership in various geographical societies. The novel also details his accidental involvement in the search for Captain Grant, suggesting a life primarily focused on academic pursuits rather than extensive travel among indigenous populations. The claim of mutual recognition through hand signs implies a significant period of interaction, which is not supported by the canonical portrayal of Paganel's life before the voyage.

Lens 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY: Introducing a significant experience like living among the Charrúa would likely have been mentioned in the novel, given Paganel's tendency to share his knowledge and experiences. The absence of any such reference suggests that this backstory is not plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel.

72,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction: The backstory states that Thalcave learned ""enough nautical English to converse with Captain Horace and the sailors"" from a rescue squad. However, the canonical text does not mention any rescue squad or Captain Horace. Thalcave is first encountered by Lord Glenarvan's expedition on the eastern slope of the Andes after the rescue of Robert Grant. There is no mention of him learning English or interacting with any nautical personnel prior to this encounter. This implies that he would not have had the opportunity to learn nautical English as described.

Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: The novel emphasizes Thalcave's skills as a baqueano and his knowledge of the Pampas. Introducing a previously unmentioned episode where he learns nautical English from a rescue squad seems unnecessary and detracts from his established character as a Patagonian guide. It also creates a causal chain break, as his initial communication difficulties with Paganel are a key plot point, which would be less plausible if he already knew some English.

Lens 3: Additional Information: While adding details about a character's past is generally acceptable, this particular addition contradicts the established narrative and introduces elements not present in the original

73,In Search of the Castaways,Tom Ayrton/Ben Joyce,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not directly contradict any established facts about Ayrton/Joyce. The novel does not provide details about his life before his role on the Britannia or his activities leading up to the mutiny. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. Ayrton is portrayed as a cunning and opportunistic character. Engaging in smuggling activities in Lisbon aligns with his character and later actions. It doesn't violate any narrative constraints or create paradoxes with later events. The novel doesn't require that this backstory did NOT happen. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new details about Ayrton's past, providing a possible explanation for his criminal tendencies and resourcefulness. It enriches his history without conflicting with the canon.

Adversarial Check: The backstory doesn't break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It doesn't give Ayrton knowledge/skills he shouldn't have, as his sea-craft is consistent with his role as a

74,In Search of the Castaways,Jacques Paganel,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not present any claims that directly contradict established canon. The novel does not mention Paganel's family life or childhood traumas, so there are no factual contradictions. 
Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. Paganel's absent-mindedness and emotional depth could be explained by a past trauma such as the loss of a half-brother. The backstory does not violate character agency or introduce supernatural elements. It does not break any causal chains or contradict later events. 
Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Paganel's past. It provides a possible explanation for his character traits, such as his occasional moments of deep thought or sadness, without contradicting any established facts. It enriches his history by adding a personal tragedy that could have shaped his personality.

75,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The backstory introduces a marriage and the death of a wife that are not mentioned in the original text. While the novel does not explicitly state that Noirtier was never married, the absence of any reference to a wife or children other than Villefort, combined with the detailed account of his political activities and relationships, makes the introduction of a secret marriage and murder highly improbable and contradictory to the overall narrative. The timeline also presents a potential issue. The backstory places the marriage around 1800 and the wife's death in 1802. This period aligns with Noirtier's active involvement in revolutionary and Bonapartist activities. Introducing a secret marriage and murder plot during this time adds a layer of complexity that is not supported by the canonical narrative and could potentially interfere with his established political actions. Lens 2: NARRATIVE PLAUSIBILITY: The backstory introduces a significant event (marriage and murder) that would likely have had repercussions and influenced Noirtier's character and actions. The novel portrays Noirtier as a ruthless political operator, but not necessarily a murderer for personal gain. The backstory suggests a level of personal involvement and deception that is not entirely consistent with his established character. Lens 3: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: While the backstory attempts to fill a gap in Noirtier's personal history, it does so in a way that contradicts the overall narrative and introduces elements that are not supported by the canonical text. Therefore, the backstory is deemed CONTRADICTORY.",0,0.028552694246172905,0.006731554865837097,0.028552694246172905,0.0009276589844375849,0.0014892742037773132,0.08140288293361664,0.03144937381148338,0.03144450858235359,0.0018558087758719921,0.030555473640561104,0.07036153227090836,-0.11537101864814758,0.015422340482473373,0.05528101325035095,-0.04442529007792473,0.035240527242422104,-0.07765349745750427,-0.09968223422765732,0.027028579264879227,-0.029786977916955948,0.010650129057466984,-0.0828511193394661,0.09237271547317505,0.013340376317501068,-0.055046241730451584,0.008496278896927834,-0.012842298485338688,0.08287298679351807,0.005404882598668337,0.0495770238339901,0.020134272053837776,-0.009880044497549534,-0.019280850887298584,0.006598086096346378,-0.05474577099084854,0.006540178321301937,-0.009540795348584652,-0.06537692993879318,-0.0431695431470871,0.05864457041025162,0.1078692376613617,0.012670682743191719,-0.016105402261018753,-0.02034403197467327,-0.04520544037222862,-0.02314910665154457,0.0011634660186246037,-0.014976190403103828,-0.009567919187247753,0.0025213127955794334,0.0019650962203741074,-0.03425725921988487,-0.009209908545017242,-0.0018907248741015792,0.01189690176397562,-0.02254972979426384,-0.05546807497739792,-0.04057101905345917,0.03196050971746445,-0.024273265153169632,0.04469234123826027,0.10172689706087112,0.05603346973657608,0.05663635581731796,0.06793779879808426,0.011613569222390652,-0.034844640642404556,-0.014795140363276005,-0.03630193695425987,0.018628748133778572,0.00986243411898613,0.014186227694153786,0.04515701159834862,0.09076656401157379,-0.03596371412277222,-0.009158827364444733,-0.05070376768708229,-0.13621598482131958,0.0334123857319355,0.01924082078039646,-0.05542389303445816,-0.025704048573970795,-0.027844324707984924,-0.09916441142559052,-0.02559429407119751,0.02858857624232769,0.019035426899790764,0.07699026167392731,-0.032176677137613297,0.004537372384220362,-0.05399785563349724,0.027611983940005302,-0.02566230297088623,-0.022902538999915123,-0.13045251369476318,-0.014405041001737118,0.02270464412868023,5.403066461440176e-05,0.035883888602256775,-0.0012384288711473346,0.06649213284254074,-0.06321078538894653,0.018182292580604553,0.0384373739361763,0.1223813146352768,0.013338667340576649,0.05737599357962608,0.015532298944890499,-0.029148174449801445,0.0482247993350029,-0.02883130870759487,0.05296766385436058,-0.06827019900083542,-0.00457443343475461,-0.07405958324670792,0.0483485572040081,-0.02243560552597046,0.04776129499077797,0.10659336298704147,-0.0808277428150177,0.010318521410226822,-0.07859796285629272,0.0022315129172056913,0.008363026194274426,0.03025640919804573,-0.10978367924690247,-0.030866332352161407,0.05065679922699928,-0.052356671541929245,0.0017070466419681907,1.6038876549451233e-34,-0.04756665602326393,0.03560488671064377,-0.11680306494235992,0.09486536681652069,0.051697492599487305,-0.0038285241462290287,-0.04079492390155792,0.06857322156429291,-0.01983245089650154,-0.02333681844174862,0.04738255590200424,-0.02224380150437355,-0.09790214896202087,-0.051092881709337234,-0.08820624649524689,0.08735749125480652,-0.012192969210445881,-0.028346002101898193,0.019285080954432487,-0.06369198858737946,0.007533053867518902,-0.029170861467719078,0.009519693441689014,-0.047160495072603226,-0.048462942242622375,-0.007814347743988037,0.06584423780441284,-0.021489979699254036,0.02241634950041771,0.059929754585027695,0.0075101833790540695,0.0894228145480156,0.046382904052734375,-0.018921662122011185,0.006656679790467024,0.036847371608018875,-0.024187954142689705,-0.08279120177030563,0.025954483076930046,0.10821240395307541,-0.0022955788299441338,0.003602476790547371,0.038579896092414856,-0.031172411516308784,-0.06907860934734344,-0.06354757398366928,-0.0031414066907018423,0.054438233375549316,0.14964048564434052,-0.04625948145985603,0.0033283017110079527,-0.08448245376348495,-0.04495689272880554,0.030973974615335464,0.02740173228085041,0.06275674700737,-0.06520558893680573,0.03061142936348915,-0.0008502951823174953,0.03752325475215912,0.10196985304355621,-0.05713934823870659,-0.018354380503296852,0.07844869792461395,-0.03265431895852089,0.03349163383245468,-0.021445082500576973,-0.020229555666446686,0.027195898815989494,-0.18398350477218628,-0.07810060679912567,0.05473244562745094,-0.07560454308986664,-0.0347689725458622,-0.08892707526683807,0.03501075506210327,0.07181837409734726,-0.07652299106121063,-0.02440227009356022,-0.046161532402038574,-0.042414624243974686,0.09927988052368164,0.07196126878261566,0.0664205402135849,-0.04251273348927498,-0.08475655317306519,0.01219245232641697,0.043455056846141815,0.019881755113601685,0.04973239824175835,0.034598950296640396,-0.03774893656373024,-0.005751676391810179,-0.15253165364265442,-0.06508557498455048,-9.807194368303462e-34,-0.02769346721470356,-0.006617663893848658,-0.022683847695589066,0.02689782716333866,0.04678519070148468,0.05660805106163025,-0.054462093859910965,-0.05041391775012016,0.04255754128098488,-0.04259806126356125,-0.03594375401735

76,The Count of Monte Cristo,Noirtier,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory states that Noirtier devoured Voltaire and Rousseau and burned with enthusiasm for liberty and equality. This does not directly contradict any established facts in the canon. The knowledge graph does not contain any information about Noirtier's childhood reading habits or early political leanings that would contradict this statement.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible within the narrative constraints of the novel. It aligns with Noirtier's later revolutionary activities and Bonapartist sympathies. It does not violate character agency, introduce supernatural elements, break causal chains, or violate completeness.

Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information about Noirtier's intellectual and political development, which is consistent with his later actions and beliefs. It provides a plausible explanation for his revolutionary fervor and Bonapartist sympathies.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines, create impossible coincidences, or give the character knowledge/skills he shouldn't have. It is a reasonable elaboration on his early life.",1,0.01022281963378191,0.0016288121696561575,0.01022281963378191,0.03758953884243965,0.09715059399604797,-0.014936705119907856,0.0050629205070436,0.07775463163852692,0.03243866562843323,0.09330987930297852,-0.0523255318403244,-0.055233556777238846,0.05616270750761032,-0.020555321127176285,0.005876700859516859,-0.024468163028359413,-0.013013259507715702,-0.03187303617596626,0.00173832883592695,-0.003337167203426361,0.021088814362883568,-0.03934017941355705,-0.017909560352563858,0.012672205455601215,0.020552899688482285,0.05031559616327286,0.008573915809392929,0.03713178634643555,0.035766586661338806,0.031887486577034,-0.05591759458184242,0.06386544555425644,0.043863389641046524,0.06031978502869606,-0.07844870537519455,-0.09550405293703079,-0.0031159454956650734,-0.011741722002625465,-0.006877740379422903,0.086604043841362,0.02720864862203598,-0.012847432866692543,-0.028350649401545525,0.04678862914443016,-0.04425020515918732,-0.09079057723283768,0.003962191287428141,-0.026556845754384995,-0.051177725195884705,0.01432934682816267,0.011270495131611824,0.03735041618347168,-0.09183502197265625,0.11472729593515396,0.024760529398918152,-0.06882717460393906,-0.11159931868314743,-0.033879730850458145,0.007721546106040478,0.0408836230635643,0.0636570006608963,0.04188826307654381,0.06134640425443649,0.015418914146721363,0.006866601761430502,0.007800347171723843,0.0466141439974308,0.053932610899209976,-0.0273866169154644,0.00944769661873579,0.08442986756563187,-0.12683609127998352,0.006966126151382923,-0.023780178278684616,0.01941666379570961,0.054213929921388626,-0.06988341361284256,-0.016794275492429733,-0.08506074547767639,-0.021305130794644356,-0.011596989817917347,-0.02456224337220192,-0.05686090886592865,-0.011085664853453636,0.0697629302740097,-0.019697021692991257,0.0765194296836853,0.04598478972911835,-0.020623639225959778,0.038181714713573456,-0.001555386115796864,0.09087175130844116,0.021918978542089462,-0.01160859689116478,0.07925863564014435,-0.0543503612279892,0.05202873796224594,-0.06229621544480324,-0.01564117521047592,-0.060193028301000595,-0.0036676463205367327,-0.07127056270837784,0.01109220553189516,-0.04870003089308739,0.05726614221930504,-0.01750757172703743,0.01866774633526802,-0.011059125885367393,-0.07644792646169662,-0.07002405822277069,-0.013021886348724365,-0.0037946475204080343,0.04223104938864708,-0.02162085473537445,-0.03352757543325424,0.05336100235581398,0.00806314405053854,0.10788694769144058,-0.008145737461745739,-0.056596193462610245,-0.07861299067735672,-0.07293305546045303,0.026696491986513138,-0.030370032414793968,0.00891813077032566,-0.05644936487078667,0.08319778740406036,-0.06091207265853882,-0.07069525122642517,0.009857315570116043,-1.3364389965750442e-33,-0.01736891083419323,0.0474359504878521,0.0583416149020195,0.0721575990319252,-0.07599705457687378,0.0920054242014885,-0.004293941427022219,0.018382277339696884,-0.04572523757815361,0.02300913631916046,0.014341986738145351,0.01402196940034628,-0.02013140171766281,0.12019926309585571,-0.030731933191418648,-0.052446842193603516,0.0073539940640330315,0.01514058280736208,0.051398955285549164,-0.09488841146230698,-0.030490750446915627,0.05762018263339996,-0.012688660994172096,0.008109810762107372,0.02041550725698471,0.0028600574005395174,0.0012995759025216103,0.0012890102807432413,-0.011745459400117397,0.023271998390555382,-0.04921572282910347,0.07553752511739731,0.020076217129826546,0.001434461330063641,0.050868596881628036,-0.0021298218052834272,0.015575377270579338,-0.009260321967303753,0.04815946891903877,-0.006350480951368809,0.04855873063206673,0.03924992308020592,0.10874026268720627,-0.0038449170533567667,-0.0377049557864666,0.09664876013994217,0.04408224672079086,-0.044180721044540405,0.10133460909128189,-0.023507408797740936,-0.08144262433052063,0.04678206890821457,0.026438195258378983,-0.08376559615135193,0.026869816705584526,0.02498132735490799,-0.11292274296283722,0.07533375918865204,0.026810208335518837,-0.08935584872961044,-0.02326328307390213,0.013860856182873249,-0.059149473905563354,0.005843873135745525,0.0056033656001091,-0.01499802153557539,-0.048187267035245895,-0.020588088780641556,-0.03266391530632973,0.04434819146990776,-0.07042822986841202,0.013399393297731876,-0.026107972487807274,-0.05983542650938034,-0.011540872976183891,0.039192888885736465,0.008584124967455864,-0.002711067209020257,-0.0958978682756424,-0.0131613127887249,-0.03147631138563156,-0.07734854519367218,0.027150582522153854,-0.02667398750782013,0.018834194168448448,0.01990729570388794,0.06378181278705597,-0.08122240751981735,0.04574389383196831,0.023609837517142296,-0.015436656773090363,-0.056615326553583145,0.022766239941120148,-0.12222878634929657,-0.1802840381860733,-5.669054769000723e-34,-0.007643154356628656,-0.03370222449302673,-0.006197039037942886,0.06749243289232254,0.09443830698728561,-0.002104963408783078,-0.08633752912282944,-0.03456994891166687,0.02020585723221302,0.0012007543118670583,0.0031009549275040627,-0.01200125738978

Lens 1: There is no direct contradiction with the canonical text. The novel mentions Faria's political aspirations and imprisonment but does not detail his family's circumstances.

Lens 2: The backstory is plausible. It provides a potential reason why Faria was unable to secure his release through family connections, despite his noble background and the vast wealth he claimed to possess. It does not violate any narrative constraints.

Lens 3: The backstory adds additional information about Faria's family history, which is not covered in the novel. It enriches his character by providing a possible explanation for his isolation and desperation.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not introduce any timeline issues, impossible coincidences, or knowledge/skills that Faria shouldn't have.

78,The Count of Monte Cristo,Faria,CONTRADICTING,"Lens 1: Factual Contradiction: The backstory claims Faria died from lead poisoning in the prison water. However, the canonical text explicitly states that Faria suffered from a hereditary cataleptic condition, which ultimately led to his death via a seizure. This contradicts the proposed cause of death.

Lens 2: Narrative Plausibility: While the conditions in the Château d'If were undoubtedly harsh, attributing Faria's death solely to lead poisoning undermines the established narrative of his pre-existing medical condition and the dramatic tension surrounding his seizures.

79,In Search of the Castaways,Thalcave,CONSISTENT,"Lens 1: The backstory does not contain any claims that directly oppose established canon. Thalcave's origins are not explicitly detailed in the novel, leaving room for the possibility that he worked on a ranch and learned Spanish. The novel mentions that he speaks Spanish. The backstory also mentions that he guarded his tribe's herb lore and nature beliefs, which is consistent with his character as a Patagonian guide. 

Lens 2: The backstory respects the novel's established narrative constraints. It does not give Thalcave major plot influence or introduce supernatural elements. It is plausible that Thalcave would have learned Spanish and the settlers' rules while working on a ranch, and that he would have guarded his tribe's traditions. 

Lens 3: The backstory adds new, non-conflicting details about Thalcave's past. It expands on his knowledge of Spanish and his connection to his tribe. It provides a plausible explanation for his skills and knowledge.

Adversarial Check: The backstory does not break any timelines or create impossible coincidences. It does not give Thalcave knowledge or skills he shouldn't have.",1,0.005049608182162046,0.0057871597819030285,0.005049608182162046,0.03577341511845589,0.06415901333093643,-0.03380023315548897,0.0375627726316452,0.02158450148999691,-0.0022217112127691507,0.1379694938659668,-0.058901842683553696,-0.10765133798122406,0.05367017909884453,0.08019930869340897,-0.07841663807630539,-0.02935628406703472,0.008330810815095901,-0.02616058848798275,0.035590801388025284,-0.014901401475071907,0.033718451857566833,-0.06481269001960754,-0.0012722762767225504,-0.04922717437148094,0.010396672412753105,-0.050035081803798676,0.05054648965597153,-0.007369150873273611,-0.02969493344426155,0.05604689195752144,-0.0360276959836483,0.029480312019586563,-0.06935150921344757,-0.06892487406730652,0.02678263559937477,-0.023025088012218475,0.07270325720310211,-0.16218461096286774,0.06779056042432785,0.08013950288295746,0.03311624377965927,-0.022217828780412674,0.003581142285838723,0.00735060591250658,0.04871802404522896,0.02351931482553482,0.037182923406362534,-0.048782505095005035,-0.048752814531326294,-0.025335051119327545,-0.019478105008602142,0.037624794989824295,-0.029912129044532776,-0.008794412948191166,-0.06376007199287415,-0.01065786462277174,0.040482357144355774,0.017642933875322342,0.030531294643878937,-0.013133139349520206,-0.027083460241556168,0.043351683765649796,0.05509897693991661,-0.016345040872693062,-0.009342941455543041,-0.005814715288579464,0.05628956854343414,0.02679738588631153,-0.07550997287034988,-0.004751510918140411,-0.015632623806595802,-0.10716640204191208,-0.02961522340774536,0.02989618293941021,0.009660148993134499,-0.006072169169783592,-0.013413454405963421,-0.03957406058907509,-0.03541401028633118,-0.05316590517759323,0.030116114765405655,-0.016855526715517044,-0.07586760073900223,-0.03288034722208977,-0.0004779011069331318,-0.027909118682146072,0.021562963724136353,-0.016305183991789818,0.0547318160533905,0.001099037821404636,0.028328796848654747,0.08303671330213547,0.07122334837913513,0.1310129165649414,-0.04904526099562645,0.018733566626906395,-0.07855743914842606,-0.05997626483440399,0.03526654466986656,0.0004289805074222386,-0.0010459967888891697,-0.04572462663054466,0.014773653820157051,0.0672922283411026,-0.0663474053144455,0.032746851444244385,-0.05931664630770683,-0.04202575981616974,0.013417107053101063,-0.048180099576711655,-0.022404469549655914,-0.0255878996104002,0.051073480397462845,-0.06492891162633896,-0.004183407407253981,-0.07927428930997849,0.08475420624017715,-0.002095803851261735,0.07443428784608841,0.05215596780180931,-0.01077931746840477,-0.13986727595329285,0.034840166568756104,0.03440238535404205,0.10589681565761566,-0.02618321217596531,0.031366635113954544,-0.008715158328413963,0.04714761674404144,0.05042334645986557,-3.567773760907434e-33,0.038075629621744156,-0.08837606012821198,-0.08452408760786057,0.021839851513504982,0.0680239275097847,0.005405900068581104,-0.04327436164021492,0.02497388795018196,-0.05720767006278038,-0.032430171966552734,-0.05013353377580643,-0.03236346319317818,-0.04152651131153107,0.04352416843175888,-0.030638273805379868,0.10428743064403534,-0.1059400886297226,-0.09507060796022415,0.07416749000549316,-0.012697474099695683,0.026624631136655807,0.03399103134870529,-0.019439568743109703,-0.009321185760200024,-0.04341816529631615,0.054233454167842865,-0.016635628417134285,-0.08455739170312881,-0.08060906082391739,0.05158203840255737,-0.08556462079286575,-0.024061154574155807,-0.017034955322742462,0.04604501277208328,0.05271892994642258,0.004668934736400843,0.0474172905087471,-0.0925973579287529,-0.01673073321580887,0.00029895888292230666,0.047298114746809006,-0.011559042148292065,0.008071490563452244,0.053359899669885635,-0.017670076340436935,-0.02851155959069729,0.04600082337856293,0.0034049476962536573,0.05735444650053978,0.09276328235864639,-0.04233429953455925,-0.02453700453042984,0.04035995900630951,-0.05706755071878433,-0.020509587600827217,0.040727000683546066,-0.017281990498304367,0.06988747417926788,0.02694612555205822,-0.008612284436821938,0.025850573554635048,0.07957260310649872,0.005167351569980383,0.052769944071769714,-0.07795008271932602,-0.08399830758571625,-0.046161260455846786,0.0010932512814179063,0.08041520416736603,-0.04889849200844765,-0.0103666502982378,-0.024042528122663498,-0.04621383175253868,0.08898065984249115,-0.022488899528980255,0.0003295854839961976,-0.004190427251160145,-0.053295813500881195,-0.02678465098142624,-0.011179840192198753,-0.027194127440452576,0.013387994840741158,-0.06472530961036682,0.13111570477485657,-0.031626880168914795,0.04215633496642113,0.08111132681369781,-0.01085885800421238,-0.042609699070453644,-0.012407422997057438,0.07094468921422958,0.043692003935575485,0.05599096044898033,-0.1361793428659439,0.024878062307834625,4.109261468358378e-34,0.003277402138337493,-0.025896407663822174,0.07511653751134872,0.027256537228822708,0.03691377490758896,-0.0741739422082901,-0.08569031208753586,0.004652601666748524,0.051388710737228394,-0.06247144192457199,-0.090882867574691
